3.0,Pleasant But Feels More Clarifying Than Hydrating To My Dry Skin-Has Risky Ingredient TEA,"I have dry, sensitive and mature (55+) skin and used this Reboncel Aqua Rich Foaming Cleanser daily for about a week. This cleanser has fragrance that smells relatively light to me, though fragrance is an ingredient that poses health risks. I generally avoid foaming face cleansers as they tend to make my skin overly dry, but this has a pleasing creaminess and initially made my skin feel good. It cleaned my skin well yet left it feeling refreshed, soft and comfortable after use.<br /><br />After using this wash more than a few days in a row, it felt more clarifying (better for oily skin) than hydrating to my skin. While it didn’t strip my skin or make it visibly irritated, by the end of the week my skin just didn’t feel as comfortable as it did at first and it felt like my skin would end up too dry if I continued daily use. So I switched back to my creamy, hydrating cleansers, but felt this cleanser would still be good to use as needed as a clarifying cleanser.<br /><br />However, while this wash has some good ingredients such as Centella Asiatica, Aloe Extract and Sodium Hyaluronate, this has controversial Triethanolamine (“TEA”) high on the ingredient list. It’s on my personal list of ingredients to avoid after reading many articles about it and seeing it on lists of risky chemical by many sources. Some sources say it’s safe in amounts we get thru cosmetics, but I’m concerned about the cumulative effect of risky chemicals.<br /><br />TEA is a nitrosamine used to generate foam and adjust pH and is likely a hormone disrupter and irritant. But the bigger issue for me is that TEA gets absorbed through the skin and reacts with other chemicals to form the carcinogen NDEA. While less risky in rinse off products, it still poses more risk than I’m comfortable with. The problem is that I have no way to know if this cleanser or any product I’m using with it has chemicals that react with TEA.<br /><br />So, for me, I find it best to avoid all products with TEA, especially since so many alternative products are available that don’t have it. I also dislike that this has so much Cocamidopropyl Betaine (second ingredient), which I generally avoid mostly due contamination concerns. Fragrance also poses health risks, though it’s a common ingredient I don’t avoid altogether (but I do try and minimize use). All things considered, this is just okay for me. 3 stars.",[],B09X23VTSQ,B09X23VTSQ,AE3PLZHW6NXWBMZ76TDVFQG2MJFA,1669914635772,1,False
5.0,"Easy to apply, hydrated skin","Usually my eye cream is enough to keep my under eyes happy, but sometimes they need a little extra. These gels do the trick perfectly.

5.0,Gorgeous and comfortable butterfly hair clips.,"My daughter and I cannot get over how pretty these butterfly hair clips are. My daughter loves to wear all 12 in her hair, at the same time. The clips are soft, like the kind designed for babies and toddlers, so they are not sharp and pokey. They are easy to clip on and take out. They are lightweight and feel comfortable enough to wear all day long. I remove them from my daughter’s hair at bedtime so they don’t get crushed. The butterflies have a simple design. Their bodies and antennas are made from a thick material that has glitter built into it so it never sheds. The wings are made of fabric. Each and every butterfly clip in this set is well made and durable enough to wear frequently. We have gotten many compliments on these hair clips. They work well for teens and adults too. These are a great value for the money.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XdV8kyyGL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XdV8kyyGL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XdV8kyyGL._SL256_.jpg'}

4.0,Not a set of 10,"This is advertised and sold as a ten piece set of nail polishes, but its actually two separate sets with almost identical colors.  One set of 6 smaller bottles come in a clear plastic zip-lock cosmetic bag, and a second box of 4 larger bottles.  The set of 6 smaller bottles also comes with a glittery toe separator and kitty-shaped emory board.  The set of 4 larger bottles also comes with 50 nail stickers.<br /><br />These are the colors that you get:<br />Gold glitter (a small and a large bottle)<br />Baby blue (small and large bottle)<br />Baby pink (small and large bottle)<br />Violet (small and large bottle)<br /><br />Additional small bottles:<br />A slightly brighter baby pink<br />A deeper pink<br /><br />I took a photo to show you that the polish is the correct consistency and I applied it to my nails easily.  It dries quickly.  Since this is water-based nail polish meant for little girls, it wears off quickly.  And you can peel it off very easily. That way, you don’t need harsh nail polish remover to take it off.<br /><br />This is not really suitable as a single 10 piece gift set since the bottles come in two totally separate packages of 4+6, and since ALL of the 4 larger bottles duplicate with the same color that is included in the set of 6 smaller bottles.  It is better as two separate (but similar) gifts.<br /><br />I write honest reviews to help others make informed purchases becasue I read reviews myself and appreciate how helpful they can be.

4.0,Perfect for skin + hair on newborns- great ethnic option!!,"This was a great product made to be helpful For moisturizing but, also being sensitive enough for use on a newborns skin. The baby i had ordered this for, has a unique combo- half Icelandic and half African… Creating skin mixture that needs very delicate and natural products that still can provide plenty of moisture. This product delivered!!<br /><br />After noticing a few dry spots on baby skin, I did some research on how to re-capture moisture necessary.. my concern was a bit of cradle cap and the use of Emelia’s baby bath oil on the scalp. Not only was it very sensitive and user-friendly, it took care of the issue within a few days.. The other concern was the possibility of getting product in babies eyes, if added to the overall bathwater.. of course, I used my best efforts to keep this from happening- but, I found dipping washcloth into the water and wiping off face… Absolutely caused zero problems- I was totally surprised and impressed!!<br /><br />Knowing the African culture needs a bit of moisturizer in skin care as well as hair care… This has covered both needs in just this one product. I’m certain as this newborn grows we may need to adjust course and add more specific hair care regiment. As for now, this is doing just fine- and best of all leaves baby smelling amazing!!<br /><br />So, if looking for a product that is gentle enough to use on a newborn… That has taken the precautions to keep their skin safe… Using only natural products- and has the ability to moisturize and even clear up cradle cap.. just a few drops of this to the bathwater- can handle the trouble spots no problem.. loving it!!",[],B07FP2C8N8,B07FP2C8N8,AEIPJBAN7A55Q5DFFPZSR2UV3OKA,1601610002355,0,False

5.0,Such a lovely set of soaps!,"I ordered the 15 piece set of 1.9oz bars in the fall/winter scents.  What I received was exactly as described.  The soaps are so fragrant that I could smell them the second I opened the shipping box.  The blend of multiple scents was a little bit overwhelming, but individually, these are incredible!<br /><br />I can't pick a single favorite because they all smell so rich and lovely, but I'm rather partial to the Spiced Pumpkin, which I'm currently using in my bathroom.  The whole room smells like pumpkin and cinnamon when I lather up, like I said these are super fragrant.  The soap itself lathers nicely and has just the right amount of exfoliating texture when rubbing the bar over my skin.  My hands are left feeling quite soft and smell wonderful for much longer than they would with store-bought liquid soaps.  A lot of soaps are over-drying, but this one leaves my hands feeling soft rather than dry, my guess is that it's due to the shea butter formula.<br /><br />I'm very pleased, with these soaps.  I've stored them in the drawers of my dresser and my towel closet until I'm ready to use them at the sink because the fragrance is so powerful they make for a great drawer sachet too!","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71B5csppKgL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71B5csppKgL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71B5csppKgL._SL256_.jpg'}

4.0,Strong fragrance,"This was my first time trying shampoo or conditioner in bar form, and I had the opportunity to try both from this company's line of products.  My first impressions were very positive - the ingredients looked clean and natural, as well as being cruelty-free and vegan, I love that it’s plastic free (both the lack of bottle and the packaging), and that the scent options were relatively gender neutral.  The bars were a little smaller than I expected, but ergonomically they fit comfortably in the palm of my hand and don't seem to be shrinking too fast after a week or so of use.  I'm glad that they have different colors, so that I can differentiate between my bar soap, shampoo, and conditioner!<br /><br />My experience using them was pretty good.  It felt odd at first as I've only ever used bottled products, but quickly got used to it and could definitely see myself using more bars in the future.  I tried both running the conditioner bar down my hair and lathering it up a little in my hand and applying that way.  Between the two, I felt that I got pretty good coverage and results.  My hair felt less tangled and I was able to work a brush through pretty easily once I got out the shower.  When my hair dried, it seemed softer and healthier looking than it had previously, and my curls had a little more life to them.<br /><br />I only have two concerns - the first is that I'm struggling to find a place to put the bars in my shower where they won't get misted by water and disintegrate more quickly that way.  The second is the smell.  Although it's not unpleasant, it reminded me a little of a scented candle, and was very strong.  Three different people commented on the smell of my hair that week, which is not something that usually happens to me.  My husband thought that I smelled like cologne!  I could see this being a pro or a con depending on how you feel about fragrances.  Personally, I found it overwhelming as I'm more on the sensitive side to smells.<br /><br />Overall, I would consider trying this or a similar product again in the future, but only with a less intense scent.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61F8IV+fHtL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61F8IV+fHtL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61F8IV+fHtL._SL256_.jpg'}

3.0,"Very strong scent at first, but it disappears very quickly.","I really loved the idea of this Boiess Baby Cologne ""Les Enfants"" in White Blossom. Not because I think it is a good idea for a baby, because boy, is it not. I actually thought it would be perfect for myself since I don't like loud fragrances. The description of the scent profile really enticed me, as I love all of the notes. I was able to try both the Lavanda and the White Blossom scents.<br />Both of the ""Cologne"" sprays smell identical to me. I can't say that I can tell them apart at all. They both have a very strong earthy, herbal, slightly floral scent that is heavily ladened with alcohol upon spraying. It stays very strong for several minutes, but then starts to dry down.<br />Sadly, once it dries down, the scent pretty much dissipates. If I don't spray it heavily at first, which is too much for my asthma to handle, much less any baby, the scent just goes away completely. I must spray it on me again. If I spray it on a few times over an hour or so, I can smell the ever so slightest hint of it on my clothing later, if I put my nose right on it. That is a lot of spraying for very little payoff.<br />I know this is meant for kids mostly, but I would think the scent would and should last longer. Sure, my grandsons will like using it, maybe or not, as it is quite strong at first. But, I think it would just be more for the fun of it and very short lived. This is also very expensive ""Cologne"" to not be able to smell it after 30 minutes, and right at $28 is too expensive for me to buy just for the fun of it.  <br />For others this ""Baby Cologne"" may be something wonderful or maybe they can smell it more than I can. As I said, I really love the idea of a light fragrance, but not for babies. I do wish the scent stuck around more for me.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61F+fZeYKmL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61F+fZeYKmL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61F+fZeYKmL._SL256_.jpg'}

4.0,"easy use, comfortable, could have longer nozzle","I use a larger plug in water flosser unit in my full bathroom (on upper level of house) which has a large capacity water reservoir. I typically take my time and use it at night before bed. However, I wanted a unit on my main floor bathroom for quick use during the day without having to go back upstairs, or for use if I am going to be gone all day and want to take it with me. Therefor I have been keen on getting a portable chargeable flosser. That, and my first floor bathroom is super tiny with nowhere to put a typical flossing unit nor anywhere to plug it in. This is perfect for me!<br /><br />Nice unit, right out of the box. It is attractive, feels comfortable in the hand, as is easy to get it going. While it comes with instructions, it is easy to figure out- very intuitive. USB cord is good length. The port that plugs into the unit has a pop-in cover (""anti-fouling rubber stopper""). It doesn't come attached, and I wish it did since I'd rather not have that area exposed to water. I sense that I will lose that cap soon enough, or just forget to use it. We'll see.<br /><br />The unit comes with four attachments, all for doing different jobs- so unless someone has a need for this unit and for an attachment for something different than what you need, I would say this is for solo use. Good sized water reservoir, too.<br /><br />Unlike my main unit, this one has a fairly straight nozzle in comparison. This makes it a challenge to get behind the rear most molars. If the nozzles were a little longer, with slightly more curve than it has, I would consider this a perfect product.",[],B07LCHCD6Q,B07LCHCD6Q,AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,1555785204360,0,False

I cannot imagine what medium or high would do.  I do not know if the unit I received has a defective thermostat.  If not, then you won’t like heated water unless you’re after the boiled lobster effect for your feet.<br /><br />Inasmuch as I can’t opt for bubbles without the heat, the only benefit to this foot spa for me would be the rollers across the bottom (they feel pretty darned good) and the space saving aspect (as compared to my non-electric basic foot tub).",[],B09NFKDCPG,B09NFKDCPG,AGEAQPHMODYADQ7BWMHM72WWBQXQ,1659596335852,1,False

5.0,100% what it says it is,"This is that beauty blender that you see all the youtube makeup artists using on their face when they're all ""OK, let's bounce it out now"" and speed up the video. Get it wet, wring out the excess moisture, and bounce. I found that the sponge is not as easy to keep clean as my brushes are. When I'm done applying makeup, I'll give any of the brushes I've used a hit with either the brush cleaning spray, or a makeup wipe, or a spot of Dawn and water to clean them out before I put them back. I shudder to think of how gross it is leaving all that dead skin cells and makeup sitting out in the open like that to collect even more bacteria. It keeps my brushes looking nice. But for the beauty sponges, once that pigment is in there, it's probably going to stain. I'm not /as/ mad at it as I thought I'd be.<br /><br />Personally, I prefer this for applying liquid foundation, because for finishing powders or pressed powder foundations, nothing beats those big giant fluffy numbers that will cover your face in the blink of an eye.

3.0,Fragrance is really strong,"This was my first time trying shampoo or conditioner in bar form, and I had the opportunity to try both from this company's line of products.  My first impressions were very positive - the ingredients looked clean and natural, as well as being cruelty-free and vegan, I love that it’s plastic free (both the lack of bottle and the packaging), and that the scent options were relatively gender neutral.  The bars were a little smaller than I expected, but ergonomically they fit comfortably in the palm of my hand and don't seem to be shrinking too fast after a week or so of use.  I'm glad that they have different colors, so that I can differentiate between my bar soap, shampoo, and conditioner!<br /><br />My experience using them was pretty good.  It felt odd at first as I've only ever used bottled shampoo and conditioner, but quickly got used to it and could definitely see myself using more bars in the future.  The shampoo bar lathered up easily and left my hair feeling clean and nourished.<br /><br />I only have two concerns - the first is that I'm struggling to find a place to put them in my shower where they won't get misted by water and disintegrate more quickly that way.  The second is the smell.  Although it's not unpleasant, it reminded me a little of a scented candle, and was very strong.  Three different people commented on the smell of my hair that week, which is not something that usually happens to me.  My husband thought that I smelled like cologne!  I could see this being a pro or a con depending on how you feel about fragrances.  Personally, I found it overwhelming as I'm more on the sensitive side to smells.<br /><br />Overall, I would consider trying this or a similar product again in the future, but only with a different/less intense scent.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61tvNITGZZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61tvNITGZZL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61tvNITGZZL._SL256_.jpg'}

5.0,Great scent when combined with Hippie Peace,"I received Aging Hippie hand and body lotion as a sample with a purchase of Hippie Peace roll on oil scent and plan on ordering either the butter or more lotion. I was happy with both oil and lotion and found the scent of this product to be higher quality than expected - it is a deep, rich, wet earth patchouli and works very well with the Hippie Peace (nag champa) oil I purchased. I usually avoid moisturizers in general as I don’t like the greasy feeling in my skin, but I really like this product. It seems to absorb without leaving a sticky or greasy feeling like most other skin creams. I also layer this with the hippie peace oil and then a little Lorenzo Villoresi Incensi EDT, and the resulting fragrance is exactly what I was looking for. The moisturizer seems to make all the scents last longer (I got about 6-8 hours of mild projection of the resulting scent and could still smell it on my shirt after I got home from work. One word of warning though the two scents Aging Hippie and Hippie Peace combined result in a definite head shop aroma - maybe not the best thing for work but it was exactly the scent I was looking for.

2.0,Glue was all dry upon arrival,Really bummed about these lashes. The kit comes with 3 tubes of lash glue and it’s a good thing that it does because 2 of the tubes were super dry and didn’t allow the lashes to adhere at all. The 3rd tube doesn’t really have much juice in it though either after applying the 2 lashes to my eyes there is like hardly any left in the tube. The lashes themselves are really thick and nice looking. Not sure if I’ll be able to reuse them or not. I’ll definitely have to order more lash glue to even be able to use all the other lashes. Once on they are really pretty and I suck at putting lashes on so I’m glad it wasn’t a total flop.,"[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JMfr3VPtL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JMfr3VPtL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JMfr3VPtL._SL256_.jpg'}

5.0,Works Great!,"I used the Via Cosmedics Anti-Aging Peptide MegaMud the day after I used the Perfect Image Pre-Peel Salicylic Deep Gel Exfoliating Cleanser - I say this because the cleanser shrank my pores considerably; the amount I usually get from a mud mask, so when I used this mud mask I wasn't expecting to get anymore results, but it managed to make my pores look even smaller. That is one of the benefits, and reasons I use mud masks, smaller pores! If you have those cavernous pores on your cheeks like me, then this will help.<br /><br />As for the MegaMud mask, it has a strong Metholatum smell to it. I mean, Mentholatum would stand up and say, &#34;Daaaaam!&#34;. However, I didn't smell it after I had it on my face. I guess that sense packed up and left or blocked it out.<br /><br />The mask is a thin, creamy consistency that spreads super easy with great coverage, so you don't need a lot to completely cover your face. It also makes it  easy to rinse off. Some mud masks it seems like you need a chisel to remove, but not this one.

5.0,Best Battery Powered Brush We Have Ever Used Cleans As Good As Clarisonic Which We Also Have,"We have been through several Clarisonic brushes in our house (Mine kept dying) and my daughter swears by her Clarisonic Mia.  She has to go to a camp which has a lot of other teens at it for a week to work for a city reach out program.  She wanted to bring her Clarisonic, but I talked her into trying this one out.  It is easy to transport and use and if it is lost or taken, it is not as expensive to replace.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS BRUSH LIKE?<br />First of all, this comes in a nice hard case which is great for travel.  It comes with one soft brush for daily use and a harder brush for once a week or so use.  There is a silicone brush head which is for dry sensitive skin types.  The brush runs on batteries which did not come with our unit.  They are AA batteries.  There are two speeds- slower for daily use and higher for the harder brush to exfoliate.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT WORK?<br />There are two speeds.  The first speed is very slow and my daughter is not fond of it.  She prefers to use it on the second speed which is faster.  Since it runs on batteries, it is not going to have the consistency as a plug in version.  My daughter prefers the exfoliating brush and uses it 2 times a week.  She feels that it cleans her skin as good or better than her Clarisonic Mia as it gets rid of the dead skin cells leaving her skin softer and more clear too.<br /><br />It seems to be very waterproof.  My daughter uses this in the shower and has had no problems with it.  After almost a month of use, twice a week, she is not having problems with the batteries running down yet.  She does  a lot of house sitting so having this handy has been great.<br /><br />AFTER EXFOLIATING BRUSH<br />After using the exfoliating brush, my daughter wanted me to mention that it is important to put on good moisturizer as the skin has been exfoliated well and you will need to make sure to use moisturizer on the face to protect the skin as it repairs.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you want the cleaning of a Clarisonic Mia but want something more travel friendly that cleans well, this might be a brush for you to try out.  Working best on the second speed with the exfoliating brush, twice a week does the trick for our daughter.  She really likes it and thinks it works as good or at times better than her Clarisonic Mia which she still has.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS for this one although it is not fair to grade it against the Clarisonic which is electrically powered, it works as well but does have the battery power.  I debated giving it four stars, but it does work better than any battery powered brush we have tested so far, so I am leaving it at five.  The soft brush is not too great, though, so perhaps see this as FOUR AND A HALF.",[],B078BBZM54,B078W6XC3C,AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,1518711174440,10,False

5.0,Thank you Prairie Rose!,"Review for: Cocoa Butter Cream Peppermint Body Butter - Mint Cocoa Whipped Body Cream<br /><br />I love this body cream for so many reasons. To begin with, it arrived inside a clear bag with a silver tie, making me smile at the nice presentation. Being impressed with the packaging was nothing compared to the wonderful aroma that I was treated to when I peeked under the seal and looked at the product. It looked like whipped cream cheese and smelled good enough to eat! The scent is a combination of chocolate and mint. Taking just a tiny bit of the cream in my hands to feel it let me know why it is called velvet body cream. It truly does feel velvety, silky and soft.<br /><br />I was able to appreciate all of the above before I even tried the product. However, using the product is the real treat. This soft and silky cream is just fun to use. Getting out of the shower and dealing with dry skin in the winter is a pain and this product changes that. Instead of being in a hurry to get some lotion slathered on my skin so I can get dressed, I look forward to pampering myself with this product. I feels so good on my hands while I am applying it to my arms and legs. Of course it smells wonderful too but the really great part is how well it absorbs and leaves my skin feeling hydrated.<br /><br />If you are looking for a gift for a friend that complains of dry skin in the winter, look no further. Your gift will be appreciated!",[],B08TB3DZ1D,B08TB3DZ1D,AHGQDSOBAIVAAKJFIVEGS344MSXA,1638291035413,1,False

5.0,Simply Brilliant,"If we're completely honest, we've been conditioned by manufacturers these days to accept rubbish without complaint.  Quite true, you can dial into their computer and navigate circles around their voicemail system for a few hours until your anger dissipates.  Or is transferred to computer answering systems.  Whichever comes first.<br /><br />Happily, however, such is not the case with the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer.<br /><br />Not only does this eager little trimmer solve several problems at once but it does so with a composure and aplomb that will sweep away the corporate fog and, suddenly, everything else you own will seem completely and utterly inadequate.<br /><br />Trimming whiskers used to be such a chore that the ZZ Top look began to show some sense, if not appeal.  The constant recharging, sweeping up afterward, seemingly endless search for single-tasking components that had wandered off and an assembly/disassembly process for cleaning the tool that would make Bill Gates weep.  Philips, however, decided to go in a slightly different direction.<br /><br />For a start, the battery holds on to a charge with a grip that would make Chuck Liddell cry. It doesn't last mere hours, days or weeks.  Under standard use, mine lasts well over a month.  Even when the battery light does begin to blink, what it really means to say is, ""Pardon me but, at some point in the next several days, when it isn't too much of a bother, could you please plug me in for a bit?""  Nothing urgent about it whatsoever.  And once the lead is connected from socket to trimmer, a scant hour will have it fully refreshed and ready for another month on the road.<br /><br />Then there is the all-in-one design.  Unlike most trimmers, which require that you dig around to find the correct attachment in order to trim your left eyebrow now that you're done with the right, nearly everything is built directly into this sleek little unit.  The only exception is a neat little detail trimmer that stands eternally at the ready in its own clear and obvious pocket inside the travel pouch.  That's it.  Nothing else to search out when you're dashing to work.  It's all right there.<br /><br />Not everyone who sells a ""vacuum trimmer"" truly means it.  Most generate just a bit of wind, sufficient to scatter your whiskers over the widest possible surface.  I firmly believe my last vacuum trimmer was designed by a consortium of housekeepers seeking job security.  The T980, however, actually captures every single whisker, every single time.  And then there's a Turbo button that doubles the already adequate force of the vacuum's suction so that you can give yourself that wind-blown look if you so choose.<br /><br />But, by far, my favorite thing about this trimmer is the way it feels.  It sits in your hand as if it were custom designed specifically for you.  It's lightweight and nimble around the bends, falls effortlessly into its case when deeds are done and assembles as if there is an invisible force guiding your hand at every step of the way.  I am genuinely amazed at the simplicity of removing and replacing the grille guard.  For a time, I thought it must be drawn together by magnets.  But it isn't.  It's just a set of exceptionally well designed tabs and slots that quickly correct a hurried approach and seat the grille home with a satisfying, subtle click.<br /><br />Most products on the market today are slapdash clumps of flimsy plastics and mechanics that are carefully designed to fail at the worst possible time.  And, for some reason, we have accepted this corporate abuse in the hopes that prices would compensate us somehow.  But they don't really, do they?  When you've re-purchased the same device five times because it keeps breaking, whose interests are truly being served?<br /><br />So, then, the T980 is a warning shot fired over the bow of companies everywhere who treat their clients like stupid, slobbering monkeys, devoid of choice or rights.  With it, Philips is saying, ""See, everyone?  You needn't accept rubbish in exchange for your hard-earned money.  We've done it properly and at a price point that is competitive.""  And why wouldn't we honor that?<br /><br />I wish my hair grew faster.",[],B000FEF1V4,B000FEF1V4,AGS3CGE7NZN7EZIOG3FXTNLWS33Q,1304958022000,1,True

5.0,"To summarize, the price alone makes them worth it!","Came in yesterday.  Well cushioned in bubble wrap. Then in 5 tubes of 6 ea. Finally inside convenient storage trays with individual slots (works for me!) Not likely to break.<br />The colors really are wonderful! Can’t speak for durability having not yet worn any. I’m hoping 2 regular or a gel topcoat will help them last?? If not, great for learning practice for someone? At $20. for 30 full size bottles! What a deal!!<br />Polish was separated so before trying, I wore my shoulder out shaking & laying them on all sides between shakes.<br />I’m not familiar with fractured polish, so just guessing the 3 streaked examples should have been shaken more?? They are the first ones I used. Each (only those) have a white base and one slightly heavy polish coat... they fracture on contact!<br />The other colors are 2 thin coats and all 30 have topcoats. Although a few are very similar in color, no 2 are exactly the same.

3.0,"Decent enough box of goodies - was expecting more from it, though","This is cute enough and I am sure if you gave it as a gift a recipient would be appreciative.  I have a problem in that NONE of the contents have ingredients listed, though.  So, although the soap looks beautiful and fancy – I do not know what is in it or what it is made of.  Same goes for the bath bombs – no ingredients whatsoever.  (One I like the smell of – the other not so much.)  Because of this these items definitely come off dollar store-like.  The wine tumbler seems well made and comes with a straw and straw brush.  The candle says it is soy wax which is nice but to me it smells terrible.  The weird part is that the gift box comes with a plastic wine topper.  Now the wine bottle topper “looks” nice but it is 100% plastic – worse than dollar store...  It also comes with what looks like a random decorative metal key that serves no function and does not go with the contents at all.  Yet it is a bottle top opener – for beer…  That is so weird to me and I will be taking this out before gifting this gift set as no wine I know of has a pop top – twist off sure – but beer cap?  For the price, they need to truly step it up in regards to the contents - include ingredients and include a better wine stopper.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button.

I notice an overall tightening due to the retinol in the product which lets me know it's working. However, the rose scent is painfully excessive. I have to hold my breath while applying because it will cause me a headache until it dries down, for that I had to take off a few stars.

The colors are muted but are perfect for casual wear. The black bands (one beaded and one not) are suitable for both business and casual attire.<br /><br />These are about two inches wide and do feel relatively comfortable on. Note that the beaded bands are a bit bouffanty due to the thickness of the cloth with the extra height of the beads. Unfortunately, these are not my style. If one is in the market for this type of accessory, they are fully functional with a little bit of statement. The cloth is wrapped securely around the outer edge of the band and appears they will last a while.

They are so easy to use and blend with the brush that is on the opposite end of each stick.<br />The colors are buildable, so you can have a whisper of color or make a bold statement. They also have great staying power, but can be washed away quickly with any cleanser.<br />My eyelids are naturally oily, so I have to add a wisp of translucent powder over top, so they won't stay tacky. They still keep the shimmer, too, which is not overdone. It is just right for my 51 year young self to wear and not look silly, just elegant.<br />I love this eyeshadow stick set! From the colors to the ease of use, it just works well. The colors would look beautiful on anyone's skin tone, and they are great for a busy schedule. It is easy to place them all into a pretty cosmetic jar or even a drawer for quick access.<br />They come nicely packaged and are more than worthy of gifting to any makeup lover. I would absolutely recommend these!","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61HQVx8itWL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61HQVx8itWL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61HQVx8itWL._SL256_.jpg'}

5.0,Great serum that really works!,"We are all searching for the fountain of youth! Okay I don't want to look old and wrinkled!  The description very much interested me so I decided I was ready to try it here!!  I've never tried anything from the dead sea and when I read that the product was made within a few miles of the Dead Sea, with no mineral degradation during transport.  I was anxious to give it a try. I try all sorts of things to keep that youthful glow of the skin but I also am selective about what I apply to my skin. Everything was natural here though, and It is not tested on animals, contains NO Alcohol, Sulfate or Parabens and is non- toxic.<br /><br />The product came in a 1.1 fluid ounce moisturizing serum. This product contains Glycerin and essential Dead Sea Minerals, known for their exceptional hydroscopic attributes and as a source of beautifying minerals. I read that in the description and thought what in the world is hydroscopic...so I looked it up.  &#34;Hygroscopy (etymology and pronunciation) is the ability of a substance to attract and hold water molecules from the surrounding environment. This is achieved through either absorption or adsorption with the absorbing or adsorbing substance becoming physically changed somewhat.&#34; They perform synergistically (which means together with) Squalane, Dunaliella Salina Extract, Jojoba Seed Oil and Wheat Protein to help increase the skin's moister levels and diminish water loss for a more vital and glowing overall look. After reading that in the description and researching what some of the terms meant, I decided to put the product to the test.  I have aging sking that is somewhat problematic with large pores and a few minor areas of sagging skin.  I read clearly in the description that Genesea Perfecting Serum helps to disapate the signs of skin aging such as fine lines, wrinkles and sagginess and that you would see effects of the serum in five minutes.<br /><br />I've been using the serum for a good while now sometimes under makeup and every night before going to bed at night on clean dry skin. The serum is of excellent quality with no redness, burning itching or negative side effects. It doesn't react against or burn the skin. I don't have a problem with it leaving my face greasy or shiny and it quickly absorbs into the skin within just a couple of minutes. I notice an immediate firming and suppleness of the skin but no discomfort or a feeling of being too taut. There is no build up or product residue left on the skin at all. This product has a nice smell, light and kind of floral smelling,  but no bad smell at all.  It is quite easy to use with an pump dispenser for the serum. I always prefer a pump dispenser as it keeps the integrity of the product by keeping air and contaminants out.  A little of the serum goes a long way, and the product is lasting a good long time.<br /><br />This product really hydrates my skin and make it look nice and firm almost immediately. This serum  really works and is reducing wrinkles and fine lines I have starting in my skin. The skin on my face looks so much more supple.  It also seems to keep down oiliness and shine off my face. My skin also looks clearer with less break outs and skin problems. I use the serum on clean skin of the face and I let it soak in. I also add the serum all over my face, and under the the throat and jaw line for added firmness and last I add a good moisturizing cream. While I am applying my eye makeup, I let the serums and cream soak in. The face serum contains ingredient that keep your skin smooth and moisturized.<br /><br />It seems to me that the manufacturers of the product have researched and thought out the effects of this product and have provided a great combination of products to promote beautiful skin. So far no complaints or problems and all the products I've tried appear to be working very well for me.",[],B0169Y84JE,B0169Y84JE,AET76WSAMU5NAFN6XTEBGJGDXD3A,1453093746000,11,False

An extra inch of velcro would solve this deficiency. For the price, around $6-7 each, replacing them frequently is affordable, but it is wasteful. They are otherwise well-designed and well-made. They even hold up well to a gentle hand-washing.<br /><br />Update August 2017: Still happy enough with these masks, but the last batch I received don't block out light as completely as I remember my previous masks doing.

5.0,"This Is A Great Design- But Caution, How To Get Out Of A Jam","I have baby fine hair.  Thin hair makes it difficult to curl my hair because either they are too hot, to large, hair gets caught in clips, or other reasons.  As a result, I don't curl my hair often.  This might change that.<br /><br />CHARGING<br />Charging this took 3 hours once I got it.  It has a gauge on it which lets you know when the battery is full and status of it.<br /><br />CONTROL PANEL<br />The control panel is covered in the instructions, but it is not quite what it is described.  I found it very intuitive, however and no problem in using it.  Just mess with the buttons and you will figure it out.  The right button changes the section, the left button chooses the level.<br /><br />SETTING<br />Every time I turn this off, I have to reset it to F instead of C and then I have to reset the different times too.  It does not remember so far every time I have used it and I have tried multiple ways.<br /><br />CURLING<br />This thing is AWESOME.  The thing is you have to have SMALL pieces of hair and make sure no other hairs are caught with it.  If you don't then it will curl your hair tight and jam it up.  More on that later.  I set my hair for baby fine at 300F and 8 seconds and once it heated up, the curls were perfect.  I had to redo a few of them but for the most part they were nice.<br /><br />JAM<br />When you are not careful to separate ALL hair from a section, sometimes the shorter hairs will catch in the roller in the opposite direction and it will cause a jam.  It is scary.  That is one reason why I set it only at 8 seconds.  All you do is make sure you have a mirror and then hit the controls until you reverse the direction and run it for a moment and VOILA- hair is out.<br /><br />Make sure to comb the hair and then redo it in smaller sections.<br /><br />TIMER<br />One more thing, this will roll up your hair and then it will beep each second of the count down of your hair in the roller.  It gives a long beep when done, you release the button and your hair comes out.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a great curling iron.  I love that I can do this in the living room with a mirror and not have to stand in the bathroom.  My hair looks natural and beautiful.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS I wish this would set itself to Farenheit and stay there.  It is annoying to reset it every time.

This kit is about as close as you get to salon quality. The light worked well and cured the gel polish as expected. The instructions were top notch, giving you precise directions on exactly what to do. This particular kit comes with most the items you need. The items not included are - nail file, buffer, and most importantly the actual gel color. I wasn’t able to test their polish out as I didn’t realize this didn’t come with a color. However I have other gel brands and the red I chose worked with this set. I followed the instructions using all the supplies from the kit except the color and I’m very pleased with the result.

5.0,FINALLY Truly Nice Toenail Clippers & Bonuses,"I don't know about you, but our household goes through nail clippers fast.  Most of the time they don't cut right, or they just don't last.  Toenail clippers- well it is even harder to find a decent pair.  Let's see how this set measured up for us..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS NAIL CLIPPER SET LIKE?<br />This set comes with a hefty set of nail clippers.  It says it is for fingernails and toenails.  More on that in a minute.  The clipper comes with a catch all for the clippings.  It also comes with a faux leather snap shut case that also houses a nail file.<br /><br />HOW DO THESE CLIPPER PERFORM?<br />These clippers are surprinsingly nice.  I tried them on both finger and toe nails and they worked very well.  I did not get any ragged edges, or dull bent nails or anything else that I usually have problems with regarding most clippers.  I did even have good results on the thickest nail which is on the largest toe.<br /><br />WHO MIGHT NOT BENEFIT BY THESE CLIPPERS?'<br />The only person I would think would not benefit from these are those who deal with very thick elderly nails.  Those need special clippers.<br /><br />THE NAIL FILE<br />The nail file is nice, very fine grade of file, this files nails decently.  The tip is not overly great at cleaning under the nail but it works okay.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This nail clipper seems to work well on finger and toe nails not having any trouble with ragged edges or dull bending of nails.  The enclosed case is great in that it keeps the file and clippers together.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS. I like the whole set although the nail file could be a bit better.",[],B07J3GH1W1,B07J3GH1W1,AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,1545168972059,1,False

4.0,"Easy to put into the hair, comes with everything you need except pliers.","I purchased these at a discount to try and review; regardless this is my 100% honest opinion. These come as one big grouping rubber banded at the top together. I marked this down a star for two reasons, one I wish the color groupings were banded separately because trying to pick through and find just the one (or ones you want) only made us tangle the hair more and we had to stop and comb it to untangle it. Having them packaged separately instead as one big grouping would have saved us this trouble. The other reason is because the colored crimp rings that come with them has a clear plastic or rubber ring inside them that must be removed for the extension to fit through. The instructions said nothing about this and I was getting frustrated on the first one I did thinking it wasn't going to fit until I knocked that clear inside ring out of the way and then it worked fine. Neither of these are deal breakers for potentially buying these for my teen in the future again, but they would be nice improvements!<br /><br />This came with three colors of crimp beads which is nice for different colors of hair to help blend it into the roots. Everything you need is included except a pair of pliers which most households have in their basic or crafting tool kits. I put one in my teenaged daughters hair to show her how to do it, and after that she found it easy enough to do in both her and other peoples hair. They go in and seem pretty durable since they are synthetic. The color will last longer than a real dye job will. The colors are bright and fun.

5.0,Right now it is tied as my favorite retinol product. It beat ROC products for me.,"I received a complimentary bottle of this serum to review on my blog. I really love it. I had finished my old retinol serum, which I liked and was ready to purchase another bottle until I was asked to review this serum on my blog. I like that this product is light. It has the same lightness as OZ Natural's hyaluronic serum. A little goes a long way. Two pumps of the serum is the most you will need. The serum absorbs quickly into the skin. Allow a full minute to go by before you apply another product over it. That initial absorption you see is just ti drying faster on the top layer of skin. It takes about a minute for serums to absorb deeper into the skin. Allowing this time prevent the pilling when you a moisturizer too soon.<br /><br />Give this product about four weeks to see any real results. Retinol products take months of use to see any impact on deeper issue like lines and wrinkles. Initially you will feel a surface difference where skin my feel smoother or even softer. A couple of weeks later you may see some lighter scars fading. If you are battle crow feet apply a little of this serum at the corners of your eyes (don't get the product in eyes though) before you apply your eye cream. The two working together will give you better results.",[],B00NT0AR7E,B00NT0AR7E,AGXWPQTZP4OZ7KTNATRIXYIMLI7Q,1444841644000,0,False

Not much is needed per use.<br /><br />The scent is fairly mild and while you can pick out the eucalyptus scent it's not so strong to be overwhelming, as eucalyptus can sometimes get.

3.0,not entirely convinced on how baby safe this is but maybe better for pre teens or adults,"I was curious about a perfume for baby because we've been taught not to use anything on the little ones except the gentlest of lotions and body wash. I decided to give this a try because I was curious about the scent and the execution of a product like this.<br /><br />First thing I did was smell this, and while it is a pleasant smell, this particular scent isn't my favorite. It is too floral for me, almost artificial. I may have liked and felt more comfortable using a citrus and fruity type of scent on my little one. I also looked at the ingredients list and while they may be free of parabens, phthalates, synthetic colors, dyes, GMOs, and Gluten Free, there are some potentially irritating ingredients for the very sensitive of skins. Ingredients like Linalool, Citral, Citranellol, Limonene can be an allergen. It may have prebiotics which is good but one good ingredient does not negate a potentially irritating one. I'm all for someone coming up with a safe and good cologne for baby but I'm not entirely sold on this product just yet. I did read up on some additional information but I need more convincing for me to be on board with this perfume for infants. I do love the story of why the founder wanted to create these scents for little ones but I'm just not fully on board with some of the ingredients used.<br /><br />I'm not sure I will be using this on my baby but I think a more appropriate age is pre-teen or teens. I may have been a little more open to a ""cleaner"" perfume for that age range as I'm sure there's a market for that. From what I read, the founder is going to be launching perfumes for that age group, so that might be more appropriate.<br /><br />My baby actually smells nice from good hygiene so he doesn't need anything else but I understand the concept behind these scents. Fragrances do invoke certain memories, just like music. There are certain scents that I get a whiff of and it immediately transports me back to that day, the person, or the memories of that particular time period. All that said, I will be holding off using perfume on my baby and will be spritzing this stuff on myself. I think the concept is great but I would like to see even ""better"" and cleaner ingredients if I am to use it on my baby.<br /><br />I didn't see the ingredients list posted on this Amazon page yet so here it is:<br />Ingredients:<br />Alcohol Denat., Aqua (Water), Parfum (Fragrance) Niacinamide, Glycerin, Lactitol, Xylitol, Linalool, Citral, Citranellol, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Gernaniol, Amyl Cinnamal, Limolene, Hydroxycitronellal.",[],B09G3LCKNN,B09G3KBK7Y,AEH7RAIDBU7QALXTMWAA73PTL4JA,1645640209258,0,False

If this product was indeed EWG verified, it would not only be on the website but it would have the EWG logo on the product plus it wouldn’t have linalool which is high on the allergy list.<br /><br />Other than the linalool, this has decent ingredients. It is silicone free, paraben free, sulfate free and alcohol free. I would stay away from this product if you have malassezia (fungal) acne as olive and japonica may be triggers and/or pore clogging.<br /><br />Like all natural bar shampoos, it won’t lather like traditional synthetic shampoos but it does clean. It takes some getting use too and a period of detoxing for your hair to get use to the change in chemicals if you are switching from synthetic to natural but it is worth it!<br /><br />I would recommend this shampoo bar however I am rather concerned about the EWG verified claim.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81CfdhU74PL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81CfdhU74PL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81CfdhU74PL._SL256_.jpg'}

It fits comfortably over my hand, and it’s simple enough to grip and hold and air dry after each use. It can be used alone with warm water, but I’ve used it in combination with several body scrubs and it further works to enhance the gritty benefits of all of my exfoliating sugar and salt concoctions.

It is even better yet if you put the cream in the fridge to cool it down, because it feels even more refreshing.<br /><br />This cream absorbs really quickly into the skin.

I tried a different collagen powder that made me gag so I was kind of worried about trying this.<br /><br />This is a liquid, but not too viscose. It's thicker than water but easily drinkable and quite tasty. It's a sweet orange flavor. The package says you can add it to smoothies, but I just drink it straight. It does need to stay refrigerated which could be annoying depending on the space available in your refrigerator.<br /><br />I would probably give it 4 stars for the taste, but the price is so high, and since I haven't noticed a difference I felt I had to knock one more star off. 99 dollars is a lot of money.",[],B06XBP819W,B06XBP819W,AHBWAVRW22FT4GAN2VTWYNAEQFHQ,1527067673179,2,False

3.0,Looks cool but messy,"[[VIDEOID:32f9e3f4a24fb4f70f4bdf096bc6e400]] I saw similar products watching some videos online, which looked cool, so I thought I’d give it a try. After using it, I didn’t find it practical and won’t continue to use it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-This is an all in one product so you have the comb and gel together. Sometimes when I travel, I forget one or the other.<br />-The product smells really good. It has a spicy scent with a hint of soap.<br />-This provides all day hold for your hair, without the need to touchups. Gives the hair a stiff and crunchy feel.<br /><br />Considerations:<br />-This will work best if you have a few inches of length on top. I had just cut my hair so I only have about 2 inches in length to work with. It provided a decent side combed style, but I wasn’t able to get the chunky sections that I would have with longer hair.<br />-The product is a little messy to use. You need to quickly turn the comb over after pulling it out, otherwise the gel drips everywhere. Even when you turn it over, the gel flung into my sink.<br />-The comb for this is a little short. You need to style the back first, and work your way forward, otherwise the cup part that catches the dripping gel on will mess up your style.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Ah9VgRJnL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Ah9VgRJnL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Ah9VgRJnL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B08TWDRTT6,B08TWDRTT6,AGO2N635I4RNMKT5SM7XONDVKVDA,1625599211601,2,False

5.0,Work just as well as the Adult version for headaches and migraines.,"I bought these gel sheets because Amazon was out of the Adult size for my Subscribe & Save order. I use the Adult sized Be Koool sheets to help sooth headache and migraine pain. These actually work exactly the same! The only difference between these and the Adult version is the size is slightly smaller (which I've discovered actually works better for me since I always had to trim the adult ones a bit) and they have some classic Disney characters' faces printed on them (I'm not thrilled about that, but whatever, I don't actually have to look at it once it's on my forehead). Stays on nicely if I go to bed with one on, even though I'm a restless sleeper.<br /><br />These are very soothing when you're lying down and waiting for your migraine meds to kick in. They make the waiting a little more bearable. I used to only use them for migraines, but now I splurge and buy several boxes at once so I can use them for headaches, too.

4.0,Love the #5 rosy brown color!!,"I’ve purchased this Kiko Milano eyeshadow stick in two colors from different amazon sellers. This one #5 (rosy brown) and the #7 (golden beige). I really loved the #5 color. It’s a beautiful neutral that can be applied darker or lighter depending on your preference. It also has obvious glitter particles which I like in comparison to solely “shimmer”. It is very blendable with your finger or brush.<br /><br />I did notice some differences between the two colors I purchased, but I’m not sure if it is a consistent shade problem or if I just purchased an older #7. The #7 I purchased was much drier and did not apply as smoothly as the #5. I did also experience glitter fall out which I did not experience with the #5 color.<br /><br />I’m rating this #5 color with 4 stars because it met my expectations but I think there are other products that are slightly more expensive with higher quality. Overall I would recommend but be aware that there might be some differences across shades/sellers.",[],B07P388RB8,B08K9B8B4X,AHMHULZNI5CHZCZGMQ6W4DN6V73A,1588874425046,5,True

2.0,Sketchy...  Ingredients?  Organic my eye!  For tea? - I don't think so,"First off for anything touting that they are Organic and then come in a non-descript bag - no ingredients, no country of origin or manufacture - no brand info, etc. that is SUPER sketchy.  Seriously doubt these are Organic - no marking as such - but there is no info whatsoever anyway - so who knows what is truly in them.<br /><br />I put a ball in my glass mug and poured boiling water anyway.  There is no ""flowering"" like you may get from flowering tea balls.  It just sort of filled the entire mug with flowers - petals and flowers.  Like the entire mug.  It was the consistency of a thick stew.  You might get a few sips for the space that is left after the flowers expand.  I was actually impressed with how much ""flower"" was there from that tiny and light ball.<br /><br />I sipped it and was snot impressed with the flavor.  Light at that and must have been chamomile as chamomile smells like chicken soup to me and I am not a fan of chamomile or this ""tea"".  It was the consistency of soup, though... a hearty chowder.  It was not fragrant in any way either so I think although you get plenty of flowers for a tub - you are defeating the purpose of adding fragrant flower petals to your bath.  Plus no ingredients anyway.  It seemed like all flowers - it really did - but I am not really sure what is in there.  Plus some people are allergic to certain herbs and flowers anyway.

Although this is a permanent fixture on our sink, it could easily travel with us if we went anywhere. Being a compact, travel-friendly water flosser I was surprised at how much volume it can hold.

It is very easy to use, the one call out if you have a more traditional water flosser is that this is a rechargeable unit! It comes with a charging cord (USB), but no base -- so you'll have to grab one of your existing ones and let this charge for about 8 hours -- so you can't use it straight out of the box.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that even at maximum pressure it is not as strong as our previous one. It does work well enough to get any extra stuff out of your teeth after brushing, however, it is not the strongest water flosser -- my husband would like something a bit more strong, but that is really the only complaint we have!",[],B088R5YRMJ,B088R5YRMJ,AG3CK7F7NP5GM6BN6OHZJRWWF7QA,1605721251517,0,False

4.0,Workman's Friend Ultimate Hand Care Bundle,"For me, I like the Hand Cleaner and Barrier Cream the most in this bundle. I found that the Superior Healing Hand Cream was just average. These products might seem dude oriented, but they work for anyone.<br /><br />Superior Hand Cleaner with Activated Charcoal (individually 4/5 stars):<br />--Works great to remove grease and odors. I like the pumice in the cleanser, as it gives me a real clean, scrubby feeling.<br /><br />Superior Barrier Skin Cream (individually 4/5 stars):<br />--Actually does help prevent grease or oil from staining my hands. Also helps keep my fingernails from becoming a dirt mess when I weed without gloves. But doesn’t provide much of a moisturizing effect.<br /><br />Superior Healing Hand Cream (individually 3/5 stars):<br />--Truly unscented hand lotion.

The hairbrush works very well in her hair and easily detangles the hair. It is easy to hold and seems very well made.  The brush comes with coil hair ties. I have never used these before but they are just the right size for my daughter’s hair and they are great!  They hold the hair well and don’t damage it like rubber bands do.  There is also a small jar of butterfly clips which my daughter likes. These are not very well made as we already had one break but they are a nice bonus to this set.

I love that this oil is so versatile and can be used all over for so many different reasons. I think it's even making my nails stronger. The pump works great and lets out just the right amount so I don't waste anything. A little oil goes a long way, even for larger areas, so it will definitely last quite a while.

I even make my own oil blends to help keep my hair moisturized. This oil gave my hair a nice sheen (my type of hair does not shine it is too textured for that) when used between washings. When I used on freshly washed hair before I set it and then styled it the next day, it made my hair feel soft and silky. I can honestly say this is the first product that ever made my hair feel silky. For that alone I give this 5-stars.

This moisturizer absorbs very quickly but your skin doesn't feel super soft after you apply it. Yes it is soft but I have other moisturizer that make my skin feel a lot softer when I use them.<br /><br />It comes in this really cute pump dispenser that is very stylish. What I did not like about this moisturizer is the scent of it. I can't pinpoint what it smells like but I did not particularly care for it. Thankfully the scent does not linger very long on your skin. The other thing I did not understand that in the directions of using it it says "" follow with moisturizer or makeup"". Why would I have to use a moisturizer after using this moisturizer? Pretty confusing if you ask me.<br /><br />All in all this product is just ok in my book.

I find that it's best used when my hair is nearly dry to put the finishing touches on.  I was a bit skeptical of what a diffuser would offer at this price point, but I think the build quality warrants the price.<br /><br />Overall, I proceed with caution when ordering this product unless you have the BIO IONIC.

4.0,Cool once you get the hang of it....but the price...,"I'm someone with extremely thick and stick straight hair.  My hair loses curl within an hour of me fixing it.  I've tried other rotating curling irons and haven't had much success with them, so I didn't have very high expectations for this beach waver.  I have been pleasantly surprised.  Once I got the hang of it, I found it to be pretty easy to use.  It features buttons that allow you to chooses which direction you would like to curl each section of hair, and a Home button that after each use, and after the previous section of hair is no longer attached, allows the barrel to return to a neutral starting point.  I ran into an issue the first few times I used it, which was accidentally hitting the home button while my hair was still around the barrel.  This caused the hair to get very tight and the barrel to press up against the scalp.  This is very easy to do and I definitely think a design change should take place to correct this issue.  The barrel is long enough for my medium-long hair and I can see it needing to be used more than once up and down the length of long hair.  The curling iron gets up to 410 degrees max, which works pretty well on my thick hair.  I've tried fixing my hair in different ways after using it, to see which method holds the curls longer.  I still have an issue with my hair losing the curls a bit to quickly but it's remedied by using styling products before and after curling it.  To be honest, I think this beach waver is very overpriced.  Maybe the results would be better for someone with thinner hair but I don't think I'd pay more than $50 for this curling iron.  Nice results, but the design flaws make this a product I won't reach for that often.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719HHd88KKL.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719HHd88KKL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719HHd88KKL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B07Q82VGTV,B07Q82VGTV,AGSTQ3JDGW2TZB5XKBF7PD2DJOKQ,1565792228274,8,False
4.0,"Easy & Painless, Temporary Smoothing w/ Serum-Enjoy It But Can’t Gauge Long Term Benefit","﻿I’ve been using the NIRA Skincare Laser & Hyaluronic Acid Serum for a couple weeks and can’t yet gauge whether the laser is effective at increasing collagen production and smoothing wrinkles as a long term benefit. I get good results from the hyaluronic acid (HA) serum as it gives quick but temporary plumping and smoothing of wrinkles, as do other good HA serums. I also suspect the warmth created by Nira laser may increase absorption of the HA serum and boost its short term benefits (though I can’t say for sure).<br /><br />I assume it will take regular use for at least 60 days (and likely 90 days) to judge Nira‘s benefits beyond the temporary HA plumping. Nira’s own before and after photos are from the 90-day mark. While I’ll continue use of the Nira laser to see if it helps, I question the extent of any long term benefits based on Nira’s own photos that show a smiling before photo and a rather solemn after photo; clearly, we more lines are evident when smiling so I feel photos would be more credible if they showed someone with the same or similar expression in the before and after photos.<br /><br />Still, I like the Nira laser as it holds a charge well and is quick and easy to use. It gives feedback via beeps. Nira states it has FDA clearance (which I haven’t verified) for wrinkle treatment around the eyes. I’m cautious about the eye area, so I’m initially trying Nira on less sensitive skin between my eyebrows where I have fine lines and slight sagging and also on my neck where I have a weird wrinkle likely from looking down at my tablet. I started using Nira on fine lines around my mouth, but I may hold off until I feel confident it won’t exacerbate existing pigmentation issues.<br /><br />Nira is painless and I only feel warming on setting 2 or 3 (depending on area). The skin around my mouth is drier and only tolerates a 2, and it turns red temporarily. I’ve tried a 4 between the eyebrows and it stings, so I’ll need to work up. I use the HA serum after use, and it’s a clear gel like serum that’s calming and my redness goes away quickly. I get a quick plumping effect that temporarily helps smooths lines, but I can’t say if Nira will provide a long term benefit over time. I do like using it with the serum, so I’m rating it 4 stars. I’ll update as appropriate.",[],B08P2DZB4X,B08P2DZB4X,AE3PLZHW6NXWBMZ76TDVFQG2MJFA,1623685953622,7,False

4.0,LumaRx facial cleaning brush is like a Sonicare ElectricToothbrush for the face,"After moistening my face and the brush heads with water, I tested the sensitive and normal heads with both soap and [[ASIN:B01648QDS4 L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Cream Cleanser, 5 Fluid Ounce]] and the massaging head with water alone. After a one-minute &#34;application&#34; with any one of the brushes, I love how smooth and clean this makes my face feel.<br /><br />The packages includes:<br /><br />- three brush heads (sensitive, normal, and massage) and their covers which have air vents to hasten drying<br />- one charging base with power cord<br />- one brush wand that operates at 3 speed levels<br />- one white plastic zippered travel case<br />- one instruction pamphlet<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- The wand contains a rechargeable battery that last for 30 uses. The first charge takes up to six hours.  It also has a 30 minute fast-charge feature that will provide 4-5 uses. By the way, I love the charging light on the base; it has a &#34;cool&#34; factor to it.<br /><br />- There's a one minute timer that has what I call a &#34;tripacer&#34; (like Sonicare's quadpacer) timer built in for each of the three zones of the face. These zones are the T zone, left side, and right side. What this means is that the unit pauses ever so slightly ever twenty seconds to let the user know when it's time to move on to the next zone so that the cleaning time can be distributed evenly among zones.<br /><br />- None of the three brushes were rough or extremely abrasive. The rotating and vibrating brush heads were as gentle as could be and I have sensitive skin.<br /><br />- The wand with brush can be used in the shower as long as it's not fully submerged in water.<br /><br />- This can be used to remove cosmetics.<br /><br />- The unit comes with a 2-year limited warranty.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- Although these brushes remove make-up effectively, I personally only like to use this on the days I do not wear makeup. The reason is that the eye area has to be avoided. I use eye makeup so I wind up washing my entire face with my hands instead as it does not make sense to me to use a brush on only part of my face.<br /><br />- There are a lot of don'ts in the manual like don't submerge in water, don't use around the eyes, don't use if you are taking steroid-based medication, don't operate outdoors or where there are aerosol products or oxygen being administered, etc.<br /><br />- If used daily at no more than the maximum two times per day, the brush heads need to be replaced  every three months. The Massaging head (since it doesn't not have bristles) can be replaced every six months. This can get expensive. I contacted the company for the replacement price and they said they would let me know when it's orderable on Amazon. I will update the comments section of this review with that information when I receive it.<br /><br />- The battery on this unit is NOT replaceable as per the email from them which I posted in the comments section of this review.<br /><br />At first I questioned why would I need such a facial cleansing tool. After using this, however, I realized that I love how it makes my face feel so clean and smooth. This is not a tool I would use more than twice per week since I really hate using this to remove makeup, however, it's so gentle on my skin that I look forward to the cleansing action, mildly exfoliating properties, and the light massage it provides me all without the use of a chemical masque.",[],B01BEYRHBA,B01BEYRHBA,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,1457053429000,1,False

When wet, they grow to a much larger size and are great for wet things like my liquid foundation. There are various contours, too, that help to blend areas of your faces more easily. These feel soft to the touch and great on my skin. I'm still trying to figure out the ins and outs of using them, but so far, they're really nice. They'd make great stocking stuffers!",[],B07KXM94BT,B07KXM94BT,AHC4NS2FA5Q6SDVKCXSPEIPRB4GQ,1549064316213,0,False
5.0,At Home or On the Go,"I often use the Olay water activated cleansing cloths. The problem is you can only use them at home. They are not individually wrapped.

5.0,This is one fine product!,".<br />I ordered this makeup primer because I had been using Eclipse Hyaluronic Acid Serum for a couple of months and loved what it was doing for my face -- leaving it much brighter -- and I hoped that the foundation primer would work as well as the serum. And it does!<br /><br />I have used at least a half-dozen foundation primers over the years. I find that they not only help with foundation application, they also help foundation look better and last longer. For a couple of years now, I've used Avon's Magix Face Perfector, which is a reasonably priced, fine product. Having now used Eclipse Foundation Primer, though, I have a new favorite.<br /><br />For starters, this product goes on and absorbs into the skin with amazing ease. It comes out of the container in a semi-solid state and then just melts as I rub it into the skin. After letting it sink in for a minute (it doesn't take long), I'm ready to apply foundation, which then goes on smoothly and evenly. Applied over this primer, my foundation is more consistently even, which looks very nice. And with the foundation being smoother on the face, my blusher and powder apply more smoothly and evenly, too.<br /><br />Another thing I like about the Eclipse primer is the way it helps me go without foundation altogether! It makes my skin feel and appear so silky, I can just apply a bit of blusher and I'm ready to go. Since I'm 63, that's saying something!<br /><br />The Amazon product description refers to the primer as a &#34;powdery gel&#34; -- and that's a perfect description. It feels really good on my skin and makes my skin look better regardless of whether I follow it with foundation, just powder or blusher, or nothing else at all.<br /><br />The price of this foundation primer seems a bit high until it becomes apparent how long it lasts. It doesn't take much to cover the face; a little goes a long way. Plus, if you go to the Global Care Essentials website, you'll see that it's substantially higher there than on Amazon!<br /><br />My experience with this product has been thoroughly delightful, and I'm very glad to have found it.

5.0,Very high quality and professional set,"There are so many uses for tweezers, and I am used to having some from brands like Revlon and such that are okay, but they are not very high quality. The ends are usually dull and they have a hard time grabbing anything. I was extremely happy when I opened this pack of 3. They are a sturdy stainless steel metal, no plastic or cheap aluminum. The ends of the silver one are extremely pointy, perfect for pulling out things like splinters and anything that might get stuck in the skin. My husband was working and ended up with a large splinter under his finger nail. Since you can't exactly get it from the top, we decided to use the silver sharp pair of tweezers and were able to extract the splinter from under his nail. They also work very well for removing hair. I pluck from time to time and the black and pink pair are really nice for that. The silver is easy to get out any ingrown hairs. Overall the set is very high quality and very professional.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS ITEM TO TRY IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.

5.0,Good texture and light scents,This is one of my favorite cosmetics brands. I’ve been looking for portable sized bottles for a while. I love their scents and that they are based on grape ingredients. The set includes some of my favorites. One of them is the foaming cleanser that actually has lightweight and airy foam texture and Vinosource sorbet that has a great moisturizing effect on my skin and makes it look fresh. All of them have light scents that I like and and works gentle with my facial skin. This set is great if you would like to try a few things at once without spending extra money on the full bottles. I would also say that their size is perfect for traveling and it has nice packaging that might work as a gift.,"[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KyNIkhTCL.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KyNIkhTCL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KyNIkhTCL._SL256_.jpg'}

5.0,LOVE IT!!,I purchased this bottle so that I could add aromatherapy to my home. I mix water with my favorite essential oil and go from there.

5.0,"Pina Colada-ish smell, Very Gritty, Good Scrub","This isn't that scrub that you use every single day, its more for those occasional deep cleanings, and exfoliating.

To me, it smells very much like a Pina Coloda, but not over powering just a nice fresh scent.<br /><br />The scrub itself is has a medium sized grit, and its feels fairly ""sharp"" against the skin.  Also, this isn't great for rubbing on and then taking a long soak in a tub, it turns the water black. I was worried it would stain my towels, the floor, tub something, but it didn't.<br /><br />This scrub is fairly specialized and is one of those love it or hate it things.

They are not a miraculous cure-all, but they do help flatten out the acne and draw out the stuff that needs to be drawn out (don't want to get too gross and graphic here). They are small (1 cm diameter) so the coverage is limited, but they adhere well.<br /><br />There are a couple of cons with these that lower my score:<br /><br />> They are harder to peel off the backing than others, and it's easy to fold over the edge of the patch when removing it, making it less effective. Other brands I've used have slits in the backing material, making it much easier to dispense a patch without damaging it.<br /><br />> The packaging is very wasteful. Each sheet of 20 comes in its own box. You could easily fit several sheets into one box. Either the box should be made much smaller or each box should hold multiple sheets.

4.0,"sharp, long plade, short handle, slices hair off easily","WOW!! These are good. They are very similar in style to all the other dermaplaning razors out there, but they are longer than any I have used. The blade is just a hair under 2"". Pun intended. One of the popular blades among beauty conscious people (pictured) is around 1.5"". Many are 1"" or less. SO, keep this in mind for where you want to use this and if you are comfortable with that length of blade. Otherwise it is all very similar.<br /><br />I like that this 5 pack is contained within a box. Many are on a flat piece of cardboard with molded plastic around them. Makes it too easy to lose one, misplace one.. they just fall out of package when opened. This box will nicely store the remainder. I won't lose these among my other beauty goodies.<br /><br />I have no idea what it says on the box. The sticker on the box says Made in China. The box says, Made in Japan. I can't read anything else.<br /><br />Handle is short- I think adds to precision of use. The longer blade makes it harder to get the eyebrow area. For that, I would go with a smaller, angled razor. For larger areas of face (or other body areas), this large blade is nice. As with any blade, BE CAREFUL. And don't over use it- a dull blade can be as dangerous and damaging as a sharp blade.<br /><br />The blade is indeed sharp. I usually use a regular razor (like for shaving legs) to shave my face. I have pale skin and dark hair, so I have always preferred to just shave off my hair. No, it doesn't grow back thicker or darker. But it sure makes the face nice and smooth- great for make up looking good, for skin care setting in nicely, for exfoliation- for overall health of skin. A leg razor is fine, less likely to cut.. but a straight razor provides an extra close shave (if careful). I love these for taking care of upper lip area, and for eyebrow area.. but is taking some getting used to since it is a longer blade than others I use.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61psmjrNtIL.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61psmjrNtIL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61psmjrNtIL._SL256_.jpg'}

There is also no alcohol in the formula so it's best used for wiping your face rather than disinfecting your hands - for that you're better off using something with alcohol in it to kill the germs.

5.0,"non greasy, high moisture, makes skin soft, supple, comfortable feeling","My skin: mid 40s, leans dry, semi sensitive*, clear but with redness/visible veins (rosacea).<br /><br />My skin has been really loving this Easydew Daily Double Hydra moisturizer. I love K-beauty products and hadn't heard of this line. I am glad to have been able to try it as it just works really well for me. I highly recommend that it is paired with their Double Hydra Toner, especially if you like using hydrating toners using the 7 skins method (apply toner in layers until skin has soaked up as much as it can). Then follow with this, and the skin feels light, fresh, hydrated, supple, smooth, plump, and oh so happy. I find that I can use it day and/or night. I really have no preference. Seems to play well with other products (SPF, serums, masks)<br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077BTR9H4/ref=pe_1098610_137716200_cm_rv_eml_rv0_dp<br /><br />As someone who engages in hobby skin care, I like finding through trial and error items that I would buy again, or would be my go-to if I had to choose just a couple things. These two are my go-to items. If I don't feel like playing around with other products, or if I am in between testing products, this combo just saves my skin and makes it look and feel so good. In a time when we really shouldn't be touching our faces (and we shouldn't anyway), sometimes I can't help it as my skin just feels soft and pleasantly moist.<br /><br />The bottle style is very familiar to me. Tall, thin, with twist off cap. Squeeze to get product. 2.02 fl ounces will last quite some time even when using a generous amount. Dont forget neck and chest :)<br /><br />When I say I have semi sensitive, I used to have really sensitive skin- felt easily irritated, often had a burning feeling or itchy feeling. I had to learn about ingredients and figure out what bothered me. But ultimately, I learned that it incorporating ingredients that help repair and maintain the skin barrier is what helps most of all. So ceramides, occlusives, Natural Moisturizing Factors (NMF), Serine, copper, and several others.. that just help the skin significantly. Add in hydrating toners and consistent use of SPF, and the skin is looking good. Now, using harsh products can contribute to broken skin barrier, but often it is simply environmental or physical (too many exfoliating sessions, too harsh/physical scrubbing, too much sun/wind/vacillating temps). So I consider my skin semi sensitive because I am aware that I used to have really sensitive skin and now I seem to not to, but I still actively regard and address my skin in terms of maintaining skin barrier.

I never paid much attention to them before, but it seems like they really stand out now when I look in the mirror. I am very pleased with the way this vitamin C serum has made them fade and evened out my skin tone. It has also helped diminish my fine lines and wrinkles. My skin appears youthful again. I was glad to see that this serum also contained hyaluronic acid because I love the way it makes my face look so hydrated. This serum is thin and it goes on quickly and smoothly. It absorbs quickly and doesn't leave any kind of residue. It does not have any scent. I have sensitive skin and this serum did not irritate it at all.

5.0,Blocks the Majority of the Light to Help You Sleep!,"I sleep better when I wear a sleep mask, so I use them regularly.

I've had one mask before that was super thick & padded, but it was actually more difficult to sleep with. Thicker is not always better! One side is satin and the side that is against your eyes is a soft, velour type fabric. The straps are a nice, thick elastic band which is adjustable with Velcro. I've purchased many sleeping masks which have a thin elastic band that is not adjustable at all. Those eventually get stretched out before the rest of the mask is worn out. This mask does a pretty good job of blocking the majority of the light. A little light can get through the area of the mask around the nose. I don't use ear plugs very often, but it's nice to have them handy when I do need them, so I don't have to fumble around my night stand looking for them.",[],B00NNKWDI6,B00NNKWDI6,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,1424200292000,4,False

3.0,Sadly just an average product that doesn't do much for hair loss and hair growth,This shampoo by Mr. Zaranda was just average in my eyes. I had higher hopes for it but it is what it is. It comes in a generous large pump dispenser bottle that is beautiful. The shampoo is just an average smelling product but again that is not what determines the rating of my review.<br /><br />Inside of the bottle is a shampoo that produces an average lather. I let it sit in my hair for a while whenever I use it to make sure the working ingredients can do their job. It rinses out quite easily so no issues there. I felt my hair just looked ok when I use it and haven’t noticed any effects in regards to their promises. There hasn’t been an increase of hair loss. There is maybe a little bit less hair loss when it comes to when I am in the shower I notice maybe a little bit less hair in the drain. Other than that I really don’t see that much effect when I use it. But it is not expensive and it is not a bad shampoo. Because of all of that I rate this as an average shampoo.,[],B08G837P9K,B08G837P9K,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1606659519095,0,False

5.0,Really seems to work for me!,"My eyelashes are thin, sparse, and short (like my hair, haha).  I had a eyelash grower product that seemed to work for me before, so I thought I would give this one a try.  My previous one stressed to only apply once per day, before bed; this one encourages you to apply twice per day.  I started with once at bedtime but then began adding mornings too.<br /><br />This definitely seems to work for me!  Now, if you are expecting full, lush lashes, I think that's unlikely--at least that's not what happened for me.  For me, this product added length but not really any fullness.  And the length is mainly noticeable when I use mascara--my lashes actually hold the mascara and look significantly longer.  Also, it only takes a week or two to see results!  My only complaint is that this is a tiny tube, and after just a few weeks, there doesn't seem to be much product left.  Still, overall I really like this product and would recommend it!<br /><br />UPDATE 1/18/19:<br />I am still using this product, although I think I might be getting to the end.  It is still giving me longer lashes.  I attached a photo to provide an idea of how it works for me.  I am wearing mascara for this photo, but even with mascara, my lashes would NOT usually come all the way close to my brows like they are in this photo!

5.0,"Real Benefits-Fades Dark Spots, Helps Even Skin Tone, Softer & Firmer Skin, Lasting Hydration","This Beauty Stat Universal Essentials kit includes generous mini sizes of the Universal C Skin Refiner Serum with 20% L-Ascorbic Acid, Universal Moisture Essence (100% Squalane from sugar) and Universal Moisture Boost Cream. These fragrance free products are exceptional for my hyperpigmentation and skin tone issues, dry skin and skin texture. These don’t irritate my dry and sensitive skin and seem well suited to any skin types.<br /><br />I’ve used 20% L-Ascorbic acid for many years and worked up from 5% to 20% over time as it can sting, itch or irritate the skin to go straight to a high 20% concentration. I’ve been using this Universal C Serum since last year (before this sample kit) and had no stinging this time and had only temporary, slight stinging when I first tried the C serum last year as I wasn’t using my Vitamin C serum as routinely for a short period.<br /><br />With regular use at least 1x a day, the Universal C Serum brightens my skin and evens my skin tone. While it didn’t go away 100%, this serum flattened and faded a large brown spot on my jawline so much it became barely visible. It also faded smaller brown spots on my cheeks. The serum makes my skin smoother and it seems a bit firmer. Vitamin C is an excellent antioxidant for long term anti aging benefits too.<br /><br />I apply the Universal C Serum after cleansing and toning and follow with the Essence (Squalene drops) and Moisture Boost. The Moisture Boost feels lightweight and nongreasy, but it’s super moisturizing when I mix in a couple Squalane drops. The texture of my dry skin feels so silky and smooth, and my skin feels comfortable and amply hydrated all day. These products provide real benefits for me.

2.0,So Bad,"This 14 inch bob wig is poorly constructed and weirdly styled. The part is off centered, but not so much to be considered a side part and it’s sewn to a hard piece of plastic. The wig is much shorter in the back which would be okay if the cut wasn’t chopped up and angled awkwardly. It’s very thin in the top and the cap bunches up in spots so that you can clearly see the wefts in the crown. There are no clips and the cap is a bit large but quite comfortable. The hairline is badly done. The fabric of the cap extends past the hair and is clearly visible. If you are looking for something super cheap to wear there are better options. If you want a wig that you can learn styling on or use to test heated products on then this is the one.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61EDN9uvNBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61EDN9uvNBL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61EDN9uvNBL._SL256_.jpg'}

3.0,"Cute, but not as adjustable as I'd have hoped","This material seems quite waterproof without a shiny plastic coating on it, which results in a softer, quieter shower cap. So I'd say it's a really nice shower cap if it fits you as is!<br />However, for adjustability you can untie the bow to tighten it up if necessary, but you end up with a gaping crease behind the bow (and unless you're more talented than myself- a bow that doesn't stay aligned, and looks much worse than the one it came with). I tried to swing that gaping opening and bow to the back of the cap for a shower, but of course it still let water in underneath it.<br />If you anticipate having to tighten this as I did (skull diameter measuring at 22"" around where the cap sits), I would look elsewhere.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yzDuX52jL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yzDuX52jL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yzDuX52jL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B0B591YB3B,B0B591YB3B,AETS7JV3ARCCFHRMZS57LG6ROYBQ,1666785318611,0,False
5.0,Quite happy with this! A great find.,"I had some reservations... I’ve seen the round wood ones around, but never made the leap. I was afraid the ceramic would make this too heavy and bulky, but it does not. It’s quite lightweight and because it’s vertical, saves some space. It comes with extensive directions - a nice change - but is really very easy to use and set up. It’s very hot and humid where I live, so I was also worried that adding more humidity to the air would be a bad thing, however, the air that comes out is quite cool, which seems to cool down the area around it (and by “it”, I mean me). I found it very comfortable.<br /><br />I wasn’t sure how I felt about the colored lights option, but I love it! You can choose red, or a brighter red, and also green and a soft lavender blue with their corresponding brighter shades. You can choose to have your color, or opt to have the unit cycle through them all. It’s quite restful. You can, of course, just use the white light. You can set the steam for a continuous output or intermittent.<br /><br />The until must be cleaned after 10 hours of use. It doesn’t hold a great deal of water, so I was wondering if that was going to be inconvenient. I ran it for two continuous hours and I could tell that filling the tank twice would be about 10 hours. So THAT’S easy to keep track of!<br /><br />All in all, I couldn’t be happier with this unit! It checks all the boxes and I can enjoy my essential oils in an peaceful, comforting environment.

1.0,deplaner wand= razor handle. Just use a razor,"I waited a little while after trying out this product to write a review. I was super curious about it, and I was hoping that it was something amazing that I may have overlooked in my skin care routine. I read that it is way more effective than an eyebrow razor. Then I tried it, and it made me laugh. It is not better. I don't want to sound cynical, but I really don't want  you to spend money where you don't have to.  See, Do It Yourself/DIY deplaning is pretty much shaving. Don't let this more expensive ""deplaning tools"" state otherwise. I would either buy any regular shaver of your choice, and/or use one of the smaller eyebrow shaver tools. Check  out Youtube and see all the people using the latter for this purpose. This is NOT salon level. Putting it in a pretty pink box and seeing single blades in an awkward razor handle (sorry, ""WAND"") does not justify expense. Even if it were as cheap as a typical razor, or eyebrow/facial razor, I still would not recommend, which I will get to.<br /><br />If you take a look on Amazon, more and more of the eyebrow/facial razors are coming out, with longer lengths, and with the hot word, ""deplaning"" in the description. Despite the product description/cautionary tale- eyebrow razors are sharp enough, as well as regular razors. Seriously, if you are looking to remove thicker hair or even peach fuzz, one of these cheaper tools will work. This is trying to fit that niche, but with a fancier presentation. Don't fall for it. Schick has regular razors and the small eyebrow/facial razors that will do the job.<br /><br />Why do I say all this? because I shave EVERY day. I use a regular razor (I think 3 blade) on the large parts of my face, and the smaller eyebrow/facial razor (single blade) for smaller areas (thought these areas only need to be attended to once in awhile). I am a female in my 40s and I have been shaving since I was in my teens. I have dark hair and very light skin, with a propensity toward excess hair all over, so any hair on my face stands out. I never cared for that (shocker), and NO, shaving never ever creates more hair, or thicker, or whatever. What shaving (or call it ""deplaning"") does do is clean up the face and exfoliate. Shaving isn't just for guys!<br /><br />Anyway, I used this on one side of my face, and use my other typical tools on the other. I preferred outcome with my typical tools. I tried it over the course of a few days, so I could give it a chance and determine if I learned anything new. But I kept coming back with same result- this is no better, and even less effective than my regular razor and/or little eyebrow facial razor.<br /><br />When I tried this product, I was thinking that maybe I would get an even closer shave. Nope, not even close. I tried it according to the meager directions- use on a dry face. Not impressed. Thinking maybe I could do better with a damp face, I tried that- definitely not. I pulled skin taut, I made sure product was pressed firmly but gently, I tried short strokes, I tried long strokes.. I worked the angle of the razor as recommended, and just found it hindered my sight, and it was hard to tell if I was getting anywhere with it. I went back and tried to research the product, or similar products, I tried to find videos- just nothing that made me think I was at all using it wrong. I am experienced with facial hair removal, and this is not what I will be using.<br /><br />One thing I do kinda like: I like that the handle is trying to make people use it at the correct angle- it takes a little getting used to. There is a tiny bit more fineness required with the small single razor eyebrow/facial razors, but I have never cut myself with one. I did nick myself with this. So maybe the guiding design isn't great, after all?<br /><br />I want to clarify: General information on deplaning says not to use products for a couple of days and to only do this once a month or so. That is really just for professional level deplaning. If you are doing this at home, with what amounts to a regular razor, (no matter the size, or how it is packaged), once can and should use their products as usual, and shaving can be done daily. If you do not have much hair to remove, then just 1-2x a week should suffice. If you are a hairy beast like me, who could easily shave 1-2 times a day, then know that the degree of exfoliation provided in this manner does not require refraining from product use. Though, that is all dependent upon how your individual skin reacts.  Now, if you were getting this professionally done (the tools are different, and does a thorough job), then by all means follow directions of your technician.<br /><br />What's in box: 2 handles, with two razors (ie, ""deplaning blade"") in each handle (ie; ""wand""). A little brush to clean out hair that will build up. Not extra razors. Not protective cover to keep them sharp. I don't expect them to last long- it is just a single razor, nothing special. The ""wands"" do not appear able to have the razor swapped out. Instructions are same as the ""instructions for use"" listed in this product page. Basically a printed version.<br /><br />Hope this helped. Again, I don't like to be so negative about a product, but this is one that I do not find more effective than what it is trying to replace.",[],B07LBK2YQX,B07LBK2YQX,AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,1555438600776,24,False
4.0,"Well made, but not useful for my beard","This was a bit of a gamble on my part. I have a scraggly beard and hoped to tame it somewhat with this flat iron. That didn't really work very well, but the iron itself works fine (and straightened the hair on my head). This is an attractive little unit that heats up quickly (if you touch it to test, you'll likely regret it).

Also, the variable temperature is somewhat of a guessing game - you know the high and low temperatures, but not exactly what's going on in between.<br /><br />Still, it works and works easily, and even comes with a nice little travel bag.

These are all sturdy and comfortable, with no irritation to my head or behind my ears. I wear them and my kids all wear these so they fit everyone.

5.0,"Well made, works great, easy to clean","This is the first time I've ever purchased a foot file. From my pictures you'll see how clear it is I should have bought one a long time ago. The only time I ever get my feet filed is when I get a pedicure. Maybe once a year. Having the ability to do that at home will definitely help me keep my feet looking, well, normal.<br /><br />The wood on the file looks really nice and it comes with a suction cup and string so you can hang it up if you want. The red side of the file is quite coarse to help really clean up your feet, but causes no discomfort at all. The black side is also coarse, but less so. It helps with smoothing. Overall it seems well made and like it will last quite a while.<br /><br />I haven't had it long and have actually only used it once, but just once made a huge difference. I did not follow directions and soak my feet for 10-30 minutes in salt water. I simple took a shower, dried my feet, and used the file on both feet for 5 minutes total. If I had soaked my feet I'm sure I would have got even better results. I also put aloe lotion on my feet after. I never put lotion on my feet and they're usually very dry and cracked because of that. I intend to use the file every day for the next couple days briefly after I shower until I get my feet looking good. After doing so I'll add the lotion as part of the regimen. Using the file is going to help keep me conscious of keeping my feet hydrated so it does more than just file. :-)<br /><br />After using the file I rinsed it off in the sink with mild soap. It took 10 seconds to get all the skin off and looking brand new again. If you have calluses or other rough spots on your feet this file is a great way to take care of that with little effort. I definitely recommend it.<br /><br />I received this file at a discount in exchange for my honest review. All thoughts are my own and have not been influenced.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711SPsHJUpL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711SPsHJUpL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711SPsHJUpL._SL256_.jpg'}

2.0,Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.,"Two stars because it did remove most of the hair, but what an ordeal! I am not new to hair removal creams, and I can say with certainty, this one was the worst I’ve dealt with. First, the reviewers saying this stuff smells nice are either out of their minds, have no sense of smell, or they’re lying. It was no better than Nair or Veet. The bottle is way too tiny, and being plus-sized, I used up the entire thing in one use. The spatula/scraper they provide you with is microscopic compared to some. It took for-ev-er to get all the cream off with that thing. Near the end, I just gave up and rinsed some of it off without scraping. And you can’t use most body washes after this? What’s up with that? I usually like to do my hair removal creams before a shower, and I can’t soap my legs?! And the hair inhibitor part did not absorb easily.

5.0,Easy To Use And Effective,"As a 42 year old woman with shockingly pale skin I thought it would be interesting to try a sunless tanner. When I was younger I used Jergens sunless tanner and unless I was extremely careful and diligent I ended up orange, streaked or some combination of the two. I did not have high hopes for this sunless tanner, so I started with a small area on one leg.<br /><br />First, this lotion does not have any real scent straight out of the bottle, but it does have a smell that develops once it is on the skin. It is not unpleasant and maybe the scent is dependent on the person, but it is there. Second, it is easy to apply. The first application I only put a tiny amount on my right leg and then immediately washed my hands. I let it dry for about one minute and then got dressed. Simple. Third, it takes a bit for color to appear. I started to tan in about 12 hours and by the next morning I was noticeably browner.<br /><br />The second application I put on both my legs just like normal lotion. I tried paying attention to my knees and ankles, but honestly, I did not really. I washed my hands immediately, but must have brushed my forearm. I let everything dry for about one minute and then got dressed. The next morning I was tan and had a streak of brown on my arm.<br /><br />I like this stuff. It is easy to use and the color lasts.

5.0,Gives that mascara a boost and conditions lashes too,"I have never tried a lash primer and never really knew it existed until I saw this. Because I am getting older and we lose that wonderful thick lash look we have we are younger i thought it would be great to use to condition my lashes and keep them healthier and maybe keep from losing some. I didn't expect it to be white but it does make it easier to see when you apply it. I found it easier to apply by brushing across my lashing instead of brushing base to tip. I even used the very end of the brush so swipe across hard to get areas. I curled my lashes as usual, then applied the primer. I tried mascara immediately and also tried waiting for the primer to dry. It worked best for me after it dried. When I applied while the primer was wet it made my curled lashes droop and I couldn't tell I had curled them. But when I waited just a few minutes, because it does dry quickly, then applied I was very happy with the results. I would never apply , then curl for fear of pulling out lashes that might stick to the curler. I also use the product to condition my lashes while I sleep. I put on before going to bed each night. I think your lashes are just like your hair, they need care and conditioning to keep looking beautiful too. I like how this also helps make my lashes appear fuller and thicker too.

It works as it should. She has polished her nails once so far with this set. As of now, it's been one week and they all look as good as the first day. Usually gel polish lasts for about 2 weeks on her, so at this rate, she thinks the results will be the same. One thing she didn't like was that the bottles are not labeled or marked to indicate what colors they are. To solve this, we put a drop of nail polish on the back of each bottle. The polish wouldn't dry without the LED light, which we realized after 5 hours of waiting. So we took a piece of clear tape and covered the polish drop.

These bottles are also great for storing essential oil concoctions.<br />After some experimenting I found that placing the label at the bottom of the bottle was best to avoid rubbing the label off.

5.0,Lemony face wash 🍋,"I just washed my face with this Sia C + Lemon Peel wash. It lathered nicely in my hands and on my face. It has a soft lemony scent. It rinsed well - and this is where you'll feel the difference. You know the phrase 'squeaky clean'? That's what you'll feel. There's absolutely no residue left behind. If you've used Noxema to wash your face, it has a similar effect. Because I'm prone to dry skin, I had to apply cream immediately. The label on the bottle suggests washing with this, then using a toner, followed by Vitamin C. Makes sense as your skin is stripped of everything and is ready for some TLC. I think this is an ideal wash for people with oily or combination skin. For me, this will be a great summer wash to control the shine (oil). If you're skin is dry like mine, then moisturize immediately after using.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wqJjhleDL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wqJjhleDL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wqJjhleDL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B08KFKKPBB,B08KFKKPBB,AF7542ZZDZ4XVE56C2YPD2DMF37A,1619268017469,0,False

The 1050x solves both problems, I can shave in less time (must be the blades it uses) and it charges very quickly (one hour, with a quick charge for emergencies).<br /><br />It comes with a travel ""sarcophagus"" (which I find a nice detail) which can also be used to charge the razor, and a charging stand; the hair deposit chambers for each blade do fill quickly, particularly with anything older than a day old stubble for me, and a sign comes up asking you to empty them - which is done quickly and easily enough.<br /><br />The only negatives are that it's quite a bit noisier than the 7120, but then again that is quite quiet... I still cannot get the best shave over the area between my mouth and my chin... But then again we all different facial features... And it's pricey...

2.0,"Vegetal, messy flower balls; not sure why anyone would use this for anything but tea","I thought these were bath bombs when I ordered them. However, that is not what this is at all. There are 10 tiny balls of compressed flowers wrapped in various colored foils. They can be used as a tea, which is what I use them for, or they can be put in a bath. I have no idea how anyone would use this for baking as per the Amazon title.<br /><br />Nevertheless, all but the purple and red balls have a purely vegetal scent. The purple and red smell flowery. I have used tea balls before and never cared for them but did like how most stayed together. However, these balls expand into many little flower particles that float in the water. If one were to put this in a bath, it would clog the drain unless the flower debris was scooped out with a skimmer.  I used the blue ball to brew into a tea and it was tasteless. I also had to use a strainer and remove the lid on my pot to keep the spout from clogging.<br /><br />Besides the mess and lackluster flavor, there are absolutely no brewing instructions, no information on what tea ball is what flower.  The Amazon site has a list of the flower and the balls but does not show the foil color. It is almost impossible to reconcile that list with what is in front of me.<br /><br />Shame on the vendor for not creating an insert or package label that says what is inside and which tea ball is what flower. I personally do not care for this at all and will probably throw this in the garbage.<br /><br />This is not worth it to me at any price. It is certainly not a bath bomb, I can't see how it can be used for baking, and as a tea it is tasteless and messy. There is no fragrance, so its use as a bath bomb would be for romantic or ambiance purposes only.<br /><br />At the current price of $9.88 for 10 balls it comes to almost $1 per tea ball.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817CpxZOK1L._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817CpxZOK1L._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817CpxZOK1L._SL256_.jpg'}

Each package is marked with a price of $1.55 each. Unfortunately, at the current price of $9.95, it comes to $1.99 per sponge which is $.44 cents more than the price marked.

5.0,quality set with carrying pouch!,"I am constantly misplacing my tweezers and am always buying new ones. Some are better than others. I will say that I am very happy about this set. My last pair of angled tweezers actually cut my eyebrow hairs instead of plucking them, which drove me crazy. I am happy to say the slanted pair in this set does not do that - thankfully! I was able to easily pluck my eyebrow hairs to perfection. I am not a person that is ever precise enough to use the pointed tweezers, but since they came in this set, I put them to use in a different way. I am using them to weed my vinyl designs after I cut them. They are precise and working out nicely. I also tried the flat pair, which work fine, but I really prefer the slanted overall for my uses. These come in a sparkly purple case. The tweezers are color coded with a shimmery glittery finish. Honestly, I think the color design is a bit pre-teen-like, but they are tweezers and they work, so I am not too picky about the colors. Overall, nice quality set!

3.0,"No growth, but an ok hair treatment","I have actually tried the daelong shampoo and conditioner (with poor results in the growth category).  When I saw that there was also a treatment cream I decided to give it a go.  My thoughts on this hair growth treatment cream are a mixed bag. I like the scent of it a lot. I like that it isn't too heavy on my hair, glides easily and softens my hair after I've used the shampoo. I don't feel like it's causing any grease or oil on my hair.  The container is also HUGE.  This is easily the size of 3 regular containers of intense conditioner.  The only problem I have (the bottle is pretty too) is that I can't really tell that my hair is growing faster than it was with other hair products. I see no difference in my hair length.  I just don't. My hair feels a little more healthy but nothing substantial. I would pay around $14 for this hair growth treatment because I do like the smell and it doesn't make my hair unhealthy. I just don't see the results I expected. I give it 3 stars for being a good conditioner but had to knock off two stars because I'm not seeing growth.<br /><br />The jar is an amusing shower read.  Enjoy it!<br /><br />I purchased this daelong hair growth treatment cream at a deep discount so I could offer my review of it.

My skin runs fair to medium throughout the year so I can use 4 of the colors and the darker colors I just use for eye-shadow, usually in my crease as a blending color so nothing gets wasted.

I has really good lather, a strong pump and a wonderful scent. It lathers easily and also rinses out easily. I like how my hair feels after using it. I am not so much of a fan of the conditioner. I was a bit surprised that after putting it in my hair, my hair did not feel slick like it does with most conditioners. It actually felt quite coarse. I always brush my hair while in the shower with the conditioner still in it. I attempted that with this conditioner and found that not only did the conditioner not do any untangling, but I got the brush stuck in my hair! I then rinsed and rinsed to get it all out and then tackled the knotted hair. My hair acted as if I had not had any conditioner at all and I had to fight my way through the knots. Once dry, my hair felt normal.<br /><br />I have ceased using the conditioner but I do like the affect of the purple shampoo on my salt and pepper hair.",[],B08QKXY1KN,B08QKXY1KN,AHGQDSOBAIVAAKJFIVEGS344MSXA,1623276456190,0,False

3.0,"Very small salt crystals, but smells good!","The best way to describe the scent of this exfoliating scrub is to say it smells like you just walked into a day spa. It's a truly lovely smell, light, fresh, salty, and luxurious. I've actually tried using it as a lotion instead because the fragrance is so nice, but it didn't really work out. It's very creamy, though, and when you put a dollop in your hand, it might seem like there aren't any salt crystals in it, because the cream is thick like lotion.<br />There was quite a bit of settling in the packaging when I opened the jar, and since I ended up using quite a bit in the shower, I don't think it'll last very long--perhaps a month. The salt crystals are very small, and when I tried to vigorously scrub, it washed away before I could properly exfoliate.<br />How I recommend using it, in order to get the best use out of the Himalayan salt is to wet your leg before you step unto the shower, so it's a little more than damp. Then take a dollop and scrub your leg, and when you're done with whatever appendages you wanted to exfoliate, hop in the shower and rinse it off. Somehow, when my legs and arms were really drenched, the scrub just slid right off. Less moisture helped it adhere better. The smell really is great and refreshing, and once I've figured out how to use it, I've started enjoying it more.",[],B076DGMQTM,B076DGMQTM,AFMYD2O2LVQ5HWBCF54SM445F6MA,1571093043073,3,False

It smells so tropical, so dewy, and so tasty I almost tried it. And it's no wonder, with ingredients of coconut oil, papaya extract, and macadamia oil.<br />I tried it a few times on my face (mixed with soap, of course), and it was a little too strong for me. The sugar crystals are large and sturdy, requiring a vigorous scrub to dissolve. It didn't cause me to break out, but I did notice that the rest of the day and the following day, it looked like half my skin got taken off. Dips, discolorations, and small zits that were hiding beneath the surface were all visible - but after a couple of days everything went back to normal.

4.0,"Good product, bad customer service (Almay not the seller).","I really want this on subscribe and save but Amazon only has a couple shades available. :( anyways a few years ago my skin became super sensitive and Almay consistently puts out products that don't bother my skin. This has pretty good coverage and you can build it up. I am rather happy with it. That is the only reason I am not giving it 3 stars. Here is my problem. I am colorblind and finding makeup that matches my skin by myself is a nightmare. For those of you who do not know colorblind is where we have a cone that is low in color which also affects other colors. We do not see in black and white. My green is low sometimes making certain greens look like a light version of goldenrod copy paper or as I say 1970's gold. Yuck... Anyways this affects how I view other colors and I cannot match makeup well. Certain shades will appear the same leading me to believe I have a match until someone (usually my cousin) points out my makeup looks ridiculous. Let me mention my cousins call me &#34;educated&#34; colorblind because most of the time I know how to compensate for color deficiency. I know color theory well. I wrote Almay about the problem because my only alternative was to drag my cousin to the store and have her &#34;sample&#34; shades. I am sure other customers and the store does not appreciate this so in the end I have tons of money wasted on the wrong shades. I know this happens to people with normal color vision but multiple that by 5-10 times you have done that and that describes my experience. Anyways I thought I'd write them and ask as Covergirl used to sell a 3 pack sampler of similar colors so you could find your perfect shade. The reply was to purchase full size products. I thought this lacked empathy as I wasn't writing to get free products. I was writing to find a resolution that would result in me being a long time customer. I don't think them going the extra mile to send something mini even if I had to pay was asking too much from such a large corporation. This leaves me felling like I should rate them 3 stars. While I remain a loyal customer they don't care about me. :( I wouldn't have minded paying for some sort of samples, but I guess they rather keep taking my money while I experienced trial and error finding a shade. Now while my cousins have not compared my makeup to mud since using this shade I haven't exactly had them inspect it closely for me after applied. I will ask to get a final opinion. The smart shade does not provide adequate coverage or I would go that route. I have that product also for lazy days. I rate the product a solid 4 stars for being a good product especially on super sensitive skin, but I rate the company 0 stars for not even considering people like me. They got my money so I guess they're happy. Still let wondering if this is the right shade for me.. *sigh* still holding on to the heap of bottles because I paid good money for it. Anyways I am leaving this review here because this is where I am going to order and the price looks very reasonable. Now if I could find the perfect powder... Btw their concealer sucks. Just use the foundation to build coverage and save your money. I will update after I get some more opinions on if this shade is for me. Gawd I hope it is. I can't keep spending all this money, and because of my skin conditions I absolutey have to wear makeup when going out so I don't feel like people are staring at me.",[],B006OY1LW2,B087J6PP9X,AGKQETR7UZS7WWMA3LWXBHLY6OGA,1419291451000,0,False

Before getting it I was thinking it was going to be like regular soap but when you see it it’s anything but regular soap.  My roommate and I were both a bit confused thinking perhaps these were bath bombs because the look is similar to bath bombs more than it is to bar soap. I had to revisit the listing to double-check that it is meant to be used as soap.<br /><br />Usage is interesting.  It does break down very quickly though it stays intact long enough to use as bar soap.  You just don’t get many washes out of each bar.  With water, it does suds up a good amount which I like.  It also gets a bit milky looking and the gritty texture does exfoliate too.<br /><br />After using it I like the feeling of it on my skin.  My skin feels a little tingly, refreshed, and soft.  So it does work well for me as a soap but it just doesn’t last long.<br /><br />The scent is not my favorite at all.  Some might enjoy the scent but it’s very strongly clove-scented.  It’s a bit too overbearing for my tastes. The scent also seems to last on my skin for a little longer than normal bar soap would.  If I was more fond of the scent this would be a good thing.<br /><br />Overall it’s a decent product but it’s not really for me.  I just don’t love the scent and it’s a bit too different from normal bar soap for me.  I love the exfoliating ability of this soap.

I keep the patches in the fridge-I get better results when they're cold and it feels good as well.  I wear the patches in the morning for about 15 minutes and I'm good to go.  It did take multiple uses before the results were obvious but that's to be expected.  I like many of the ingredients in the patches, including: collagen, hyaluronic acid (HUGE fan!), and aloe, to name a few.  I'm not a  fan of the roller, unfortunately.  I just do not care for the way it feels on skin...its not smooth and gentle, more like tugging and pulling.  I will be passing it along to my mom who is anxious to try it.<br /><br />While I'm not a fan of the roller, I am a fan of the patches and am pleased with the results they provide.

I don’t always get a good night’s sleep and in the morning, the puffiness shows and sometimes dark circles accompany the puffiness.<br /><br />This Eye Firming Serum works unbelievably fast. The puffiness goes away within an hour. As for dark circles, they do fade out with daily use- you will notice a difference within a week. The main thing I noticed is a tighter, firmer feel of my under eye area. This tightening and firming of the delicate eye area actually does make fine lines disappear. Age spots don’t disappear, but your skin will brighten up.<br /><br />This Eye Firming Serum is so easy to use. You simply apply a drop or two with the dropper and lightly dab into your skin with a finger. If you do this at night, you will wake up to a firmer skin and it looks brighter, but it’s the feeling of firmness and tightness you will love. Applying a good moisturizer after the Eye Serum really makes your under eye skin look fabulous and feeling hydrated.

I also did not experience the typical loss of bristles I usually do with a boar bristle brush. Most animal hair brushes seem to shed for a while and then stop shedding. So far I have not had that problem.<br /><br />I actually cannot believe this is priced at $7.29 because most boar bristles brushes of this size are in the $28 to $30 range. The price, coupled with the style, finish, and functionality of this hairbrush is outstanding in my opinion.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81rMrTImr8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81rMrTImr8L._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81rMrTImr8L._SL256_.jpg'}

4.0,A beauty industry expert's professional opinion,"Not all Obagi products are made at the same place -- but i found out that this formula is made by one of the top skincare labs in the US--one that manufactures high-end dermatologist and clinical skincare brands on the market today. So knowing this, i knew there would be *some* efficacy to this product. I actually LIKE that ingredients are straightforward and not full of fluff:<br /><br />Water (Aqua), Dipropylene Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Caffeine, Malonic Acid, Zinc Carbonate, Arginine, Laureth-9, Copper Carbonate Hydroxide, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin<br /><br />To be honest--if you're looking to reduce eye puffiness and dark circles, this won't do much.  If found no visible evidence of that in my use. BUT--it's really good at minimizing fine lines, plumping up the skin, and returning elasticity to the skin. That's why it's called ""Elasti-derm"", to help coax the skin into being more hydrated, refined, and pliant, thus reducing the signs of lines. Obagi's main active to do that is malonic acid, and I give a big thumbs up to the addition of arginine-- a powerful delivery vehicle to help drive the malonic acid further into the skin for more efficacy. As many in the skincare industry know, anything with arginine helps make the active ingredient even more ""active"".<br /><br />The stainless steel ball is not just a ""feel good"" gimmick -- it actually helps to massage this serum into the delicate eye skin, further pushing the ingredients into the dermis. After using an entire bottle of this product, i definitely experienced a reduction in the signs of my fine lines. the skin was plumped up and the lines less visible, plus the texture more refined. Used in conjunction with a good eye cream and alternating with Vitamin C serum, this is a great addition to any anti-aging regimen. I would surely purchase again.<br /><br />I take off one star because I do not like the plastic packaging, as glass is the safest material for stability, and plastic has a tendency to shorten the shelf life of a formula. Plus plastics are not as safe we think.",[],B0097G4QY4,B0097G4QY4,AGCXLRMTTQO4VGIB3RWMXECECWTQ,1418672441000,11,False

4.0,"Works quickly and effectively, but is overpriced.","This nail polish remover works very well. It quickly and completely removes nail polish from fingernails and toenails. It’s nice that they included vitamin E and panthenol in the formula. However, I always wash my hands and feet after using nail polish remover, so I don’t think the added panthenol and vitamin E stay on long enough to provide any significant benefits. This product works well enough to deserve 5 stars, but I detracted a star because of the retail cost. There are more affordable nail polish removers that work just as well as this does. The additions of panthenol and vitamin E do not justify the high retail price.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61QWc9k3TnL.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61QWc9k3TnL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61QWc9k3TnL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B07SDQNK1R,B07SDQNK1R,AGCV6N4LVTEQVYSE3LXR3J2QB3EA,1567103532894,2,False

How it  makes my skin feel great as I'm washing with Easydew and even better after I've rinsed it off? How much I love the scent?<br /><br />Don't worry, I'll tell you everything! This is  my first ever Easydew product. In fact, prior to seeing this face wash in my VINE offers, I'd never even heard of Easydew brand products.  I'm so happy I ordered it.<br /><br />A nice, thin line of the wash dispenses from the tube.  (The tube is very sturdy and durable, for those interested in packaging) Now, the wash starts out like a kind of lotion but it lathers quickly and easily into a light, whipped foam. ( A dime size amount is all I need to sufficiently cover my face/forehead.  ) The whipped foam is SO creamy and it just feels so darn good as I apply it and when its on my face.  IDK if its possible but I swear I can feel it cleaning, hydrating and moisturizing my skin pretty much immediately.  After I rinse with lukewarm water and pat my skin dry with a towel, my skin is soft, smooth, clean and has  a bit of a glow.  It looks and feels so good and healthy. It feels fresh.  And it feels that way long after I've used Easydew.  Easydew leaves my skin feeling like it did when I was younger-before I used makeup, before I spent too much time in the sun unprotected.  It feels revived and I just love that feeling!  Everything about this daily wash is perfect in my book.  It works great and makes my skin look/feel great. The ingredients and what they do for skin is impressive. (I recommend taking a minute to read the info above regarding the ingredients!)  The scent is wonderful (though it vanishes VERY quickly).  And I have no issues using it on my dry, very sensitive skin.  The price is more than reasonable, especially with the results the wash brings and the fact only a small amount is needed when I wash my face.

4.0,Surprisingly this works well to remove my cream eye make-up,"I tried many different make-up remover products and have always been disappointed because they never remove what they say it will remove and I have to use a ton of solution or wipes. However, these surprisingly work. I used this to remove cream eyeshadow and it did a wonderful job. In addition, my lids felt moisturized. Note each cloth is infused with Vitamin E and Aloe.<br /><br />There are 10 (I received 11) individually wrapped disposable cloths in each package. They come loosely packaged in an envelope, so I have to put them in a zip lock bag to store.<br /><br />At the current price of 9.50 ($10 minus 5%), it comes to $.95 cents per remover cloth. I certainly would not make a steady diet of these since they are expensive, but they are perfect for that once-in-awhile situation where one needs to remove their make-up without soap and water. ","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81UIisyxLWL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81UIisyxLWL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81UIisyxLWL._SL256_.jpg'}

5.0,Excellent electric toothbrush for sensitive teeth and gums,I really put a lot of effort into taking care of my teeth and gums but for some reason I've always been plagued by sensitive teeth and due to bruxism have receding gums that are also sensitive.  My dentist is excellent and has always told me that since I take such good care manually the effect would always be better and more thorough than with an electric toothbrush.  Till the Oral B Smartseries 4000 Professional Care electric brush that is.  When I saw this brush I showed all the info on it to my dentist and he told me I should take a try with this one.<br /><br />And thank God I did.  Other electric toothbrushes I have used were painful for me and not effective.  This one is so easy to maneuver for deep and thourough cleaning.  Whether using the deep clean mode or the one for sensitive teeth both have improved my oral hygiene greatly.  I was very impressed that the deep clean mode wasn't too intense.  My dentist is thrilled.  My gums have come back to new life a healthy pink and are no longer sensitive.  And my teeth?  The plaque removal here is superb and my sensitive teeth have improved more with this brush than with any desensitizing paste I have used.  My dentist said it is because the brush is doing what it needs to do and not stressing the teeth by using a faster speed that is just not necessary.<br /><br />Everything else about this electric toothbrush I found to be very user friendly as well.  Both my dentist and I are very impressed with this 4000 Professional care product.  I give it my highest recommendation and for people with sensitive teeth and gums finding a product that really works and helps means a lot.,[],B007VXJK6E,B007VXJK6E,AHWYSJIMUEIUBSBWKASEA5WOSCGA,1342642120000,0,False

I was about to order another one, already cursing for having to go back to blades even if only temporarily; but before that I took it to a specialized shop; they opened it and showed me it was wet on the inside and told me the ""circuit"" was fried. I explained that I had followed the manual to the letter, cleaning the shaving heads and the hair chamber with hot running water. They suggested taking the shaving unit off when I rinse it, use only warm (not hot) water, and *not* cleaning the hair chamber with water... They essentially sold me a brand new Philips HQ7120 as a replacement to use with my existing shaving unit for a reasonable price; it looks exactly the same except it has a ""Low"" red light.<br /><br />The interesting bit is that I had gone to them about a month ago to buy a new shaving unit and they told me the HQ9 heads would work fine with these models, not just the HQ8; the HQ9 feel even better, so much so that I would definitely buy the 8xxx series which use the HQ9...

Because I have been using products to work on wrinkles and younger looking skin regularly for the past few years, it's difficult to see new results. This eye cream is a nice creamy consistency. I don't notice any smell from it at all. I am able to apply this to the eye area of both of my eyes with just one dispense from the pump. It absorbs nicely into my skin and keeps my delicate eye skin well hydrated. One thing that I especially like is that it doesn't sting my eyes! I have ultra sensitive eyes and if I sweat, make up and skin care products will often get rubbed into my eyes. Some products cause them to sting or burn. We're having a hot summer here in Georgia and even with sweating, I have not had any issues with it stinging or burning.

5.0,"thin, light weight lotion that is perfectly rich. Makes for instantly supple, radiant, soft skin","I really like this OGANA CELL Peptide Concentrating Amazing Lotion. I'm going with 5 (4.5 if I could, but leans more 5 than 4) even at early impression. Sometimes you just know.  I have been using it with their Real Ampoule Drops, which I rated a 4 at this time (4.5 if I could. ) as I need more time with it. However, this lotion has been easier to determine because it instantly lends a dewy, supple, perfectly moisturized skin that lasts all day and night (or night and day in my case as I have been using it at night). Anything else it is a doing for me is a bonus, and I know will take time, but right now the instant effect is lovely feeling, radiant skin.<br /><br /> It is a thin, light lotion but it is rich. I love how it feels, and how good my skin looks come morning. Little goes a long way. Maybe it is a combo of this and the drops (which instant absorb, and works well with this lotion). No matter, I am pleased with my experience with Organa Cell products so far. SO much so that I have been looking into other products. I am a big fan of K-beauty, and will likely buy their sunscreen soon.<br /><br />Now, I have no idea what the full ingredient list. I will double check the packaging to see if it is there. I went to their website (Korean, so you will need a web translator) and they do not have the full ingredient  list shown (unless I missed it). Pretty much what you see on this product page is what you will see on their actual web page. I sniffed around other merchant pages (jolse,wantitall,koreanbeautybox, etc). but just found the same info.<br /><br />Real Ampoule Drops: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X4FDWKP<br /><br />My skin: mid 40s, dry, CLEAR (no acne), smooth, but contend with Type 1 Rosacea (redness, visible veins, no bumps). ALL that I have tried by Organa Cell has been gentle, no discernable scent, absorbs well, and feels good on the skin. Great for sensitive skin as it has components to help protect, build, maintain skin barrier.<br /><br />I dont rate based on price, we all have our own budgets. Organa Cell is pricier than most K-beauty I try, but it is still a brand I would recommend. I would like to see a full ingredient list, but I also find that it doesn't stop me from using their products and considering other purchases. Take my money, haha<br /><br />If I experience anything else worth sharing, I will be back to do so.",[],B07RBSLNFR,B07RBSLNFR,AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,1618154434194,0,False

4.0,Good package with basic Sonicare toothbrush and Airfloss.,"This package comes with both the Essense toothbrush and the Airfloss.  The Essence is a a basic Sonicare brush without advanced features.  The brush is perfect for first time Sonicare users who don't want to spend a lot.  The toothbrush will do what you need to keep your teeth and gums in good shape without breaking the bank. The Essence does come with a 2 minute timer, which is a great feature at this price range.  The timer really helps you get all your teeth clean without spending too much time in one area.<br /><br />The Airfloss is a nice way to help your gums if you are not fond of doing regular flossing.  Regular floss is the best way to go but if you are like me and are not good at doing that often, the Airfloss is a great way to go to help improve gum health.  I usually put in a fluoride mouthwash into the floss liquid reservoir and that works well.  I find it easy to move around my mouth with the Airfloss and I can complete the flossing very quickly.<br /><br />For the price of this package, you get a good entry level Sonicare and the Airfloss, both will help with improving your teeth and gum health.  I have been using Sonicare for years and really like them as they improve my dental visits.  If you haven't tried out Sonicare give it a try for better gum health.",[],B01M7UMAUG,B01M7UMAUG,AETEEKM7PARPRYDBP4JIH6LIRHJA,1508039027187,0,False

I have seen an ad for something like this before from Revlon and have been meaning to get my hands on it. This set comes with 2 volcanic balls, a holder, drying mat and drawstring bag. The volcanic ball did a decent job of removing excess oil without ruining my makeup. It took a couple of tries in some areas versus others. I felt a slight cooling effect while using this. This glides smoothly on to the skin.

4.0,"Vibrant color, but very messy.","I'm posting a pic of my hair pre-bleach, post bleach, and post pink dye. I probably didn't need to bleach it but the last time I tried to dye my hair with pinks (two different brands) it just didn't take very well.<br /><br />This took very well. The kit includes all you need (I used different gloves just because I prefer others). The directions are simple and complete. I would say that if you have hair longer than chin, maybe shoulder length, you will need at least two boxes. I have a pixie cut and used about half of both the bleach and dye. I always follow the direction when bleaching and did follow their directions. I never follow directions when using these &#34;Direct dye&#34; bright colors. Instead of the 30-60 minutes, I left mine in for 5 hours. I got a very vibrant pink (a little more fuchsia than the pictures on the box).<br /><br />My one complaint is that this definitely left me with more dye rubbing off than some other brands have. When I used other brands I might wake up the next morning to a streak light on my pillow and that was with lot of hair. Using this on short hair, my pillow looked like a pink paintball fight happened. This and all dyes like it will dye anything and everything they touch. So I highly recommend two things - 1. protect everything (your skin around your face and neck with Vaseline) 2. If possible do NOT rinse your hair in a shower/bathtub. If you have access to a stainless steel sink or some kind of utility / laundry room sink where stains won't matter, that is so much easier to clean.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51hQEFZL+uL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51hQEFZL+uL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51hQEFZL+uL._SL256_.jpg'}]",B001540XWK,B001540XWK,AHPAXGZTH4KAGQHOWQ4SGU4BN23Q,1441935489000,4,False

4.0,you will see results if you commit to it,"I've been using this for 3 months now and I do think this works with longterm use. You obviously aren't going to see overnight results but if you keep at it you will notice a difference on your wrinkles. Luckily I don't have too many yet but I did use it on the little areas where I'm starting to see wrinkles. I noticed a tightening of the areas I used the laser on for the past 3 months. I really liked the hyaluronic acid serum that was included in the set - the serum felt gentle and has no smell (fragrance free). On some days where I didn't use the laser I would still use the serum to moisturize my face. I looked into purchasing just the serum, which they do have for sale, as I really like the product. The laser is easy to operate and charge (usb). I didn't use this daily as I wanted to give my skin a rest, but I think if you used this religiously then you would see results at a much faster rate. It isn't painful, but you feel a little zap. I would equate it to the same level of ""pain"" as a derma roller, that spikey/zappy feeling - not painful, not super uncomfortable. That of course, will depend on your skin sensitivity. I recommend using the lowest setting first then working your way up as your skin sensitivity will allow. Don't force your skin into what it cannot handle - listen to your body's reaction!<br /><br />I've seen so many of these laser type products for the skin/body, and never tried it because I didn't trust it. Nira is the first at home laser product that I decided to give a chance to, as I trust it. Overall I am not disappointed but do know that you need to commit to it if you want to see results.

Thank God, we seem to be passing that era, but hairstyling implements seem to be lagging behind. I was dying to try this diffuser to see if it emulated the gizmo from long ago, and it does. Well made hair styling tool that gives lift and volume to your hair, I love it. Well, kinda.<br /><br />I'm not sure how 'universal' this is. I tried it on my current blowdryer, and it didn't fit. I had to go digging around until I finally found a Conair dryer upon which it fit, and the funny thing is that it fit like it was MADE for the dryer. The odd thing is that the Conair looks to have the same kind of nozzle the other blowdryer had, so go figger.<br /><br />IF you have a blowdryer that marries this diffuser well, this is definitely something you're going to want in your hair arsenal. It'd almost be worth getting a new dryer just to use this, it's that good (one star off for the weirdess of the 'universal' claim.)",[],B00PM5QEX0,B00PM5QEX0,AH3KEDBPWJGL24RNC6VTJOJGYXSA,1472778879000,2,False

5.0,"Works GREAT! I Am Excited About These - they stick really, really good and easy!","These are perfect for doing your own Gel nails at home. They were really, really easy to apply and seem strong. So far so good. I am on day 3 with these Guards under my OPI Gelcolor and excited about them. YAY! no more damaged nails!  I didn’t have to use OPI bondAid with them. I only used the nail Guard on my bare nails but I did make sure there was no residue or dust on my nails before applying the Guard, I just applied 1 basecoat, 2 gelcolor and  1 top coat on top of the nail Guards.<br /><br />They feel really strong, protected and stable. I’ve been doing dishes and everything....No peeling... No lifting.. No chipping. My nails still look as good as new! You can’t tell at all that the Nail Guards are under my gelcolor. I can finally grow my nails out without all the torture in taking gel or tips off and no more sanding down. Yep, supposedly you can use these under acrylic or gel TIPs too! maybe even tips that you glue on? that’s amazing! but I am trying Gelcolor first. We’ll see, I will update in two weeks but so far so good. There are youtube videos demonstrating how easy it is to take them off without any damage... These are amazing. Revolutionary indeed! I will update in weeks.<br /><br />UPDATE: I LOVE THESE GUARDS.... that being said the truth is these lasted for exactly 2 weeks. I think I could of gotten longer if I capped my tips better with gel  because the edge of my nail tips were the first area to start showing wear and ever so sightly the guards at the tip started to peel (2 weeks). It was soo easy to take the Guards and GelColor off, in a matter of a few minutes.  My natural nail is perfect after taking them off... no damage, no dryness, no staining, no brittleness. My tips were white and not stained and my nail beds were a normal pink and best of all they have grown out healthy and are my own nails,  YAY!!!  I will never need fake tips again. I am sooo excite how well these worked.  Honestly they never looked so good after taking off any nail color that includes plain nail polish which would stain my nails and dry out from nail polish remover. The bond of these shields sticks very well and strong. Also anyone having trouble with gel sticking to there natural nails because of their own natural nail chemistry.... this maybe be a great solution for you.<br /><br />UPDATE: Amazing! I have figured out the PERFECT combination to make them last longer then 2 weeks, actually they last  until I am ready to remove. Here’s what I do... I prep my nails using opi nas99 and opi bondaid then I apply the Nail guards, then I apply 2 thin coats of HARD gel I used iBD hard gel (nail builder) right over the Nail Guards, cap the end of the nails well, then I apply 2 coats of color gel (GelColor) and then 1 or 2 coats of OPI Top coat the OPI Top Coat  is stronger then the gelcolor so I usually put 2 coats of top top but 1 is fine, it just depends on what you like, I  like my nails supper glossy, a little thicker, this combination makes them super strong. Caping the NailGuard on the end with iBD Hard gel is the secret to gelcolor lasting longer. This combination last for weeks on end without any peeling or chipping. My nails are now super strong and protected, are healthier,  my manicure stays for weeks on end and best of all it easily comes off when I am ready to take it off with no damage. The only thing is I have to use my regular UV light for the Hard gel (180 sec ea coat of hard gel) to cure and I use my LED OPI Light (30 sec ea coat) for my Gelcolor to cure but it’s 100% worth it!",[],B00TGAZXP2,B00TGAZXP2,AF7RSL3HRV7TJDGWQU5YL235BTYQ,1463409931000,55,True

It’s very cute and does give the oversized look when wearing it.<br /><br />What I don’t like and why I didn’t give 5 stars:<br />1. It gets “runs” easily. You can see from my picture there’s several “runs” like would happen to a set of tights. When you’re wearing it however they’re not obvious at all.<br />2. This might be a no brainer because of the size but this is not really a wrist scrunchie, it’s so large wrist wear isn’t practical. You’ll need to either commit to wearing this all day or have some bag or purse to keep it in, this is slightly less practical for daily use then I personally like.<br />3. It’s not tight enough to be used alone, you’ll need to first use a regular hair tie and then add this for decoration, I prefer scrunchies alone because hair ties hurt after a while but this scrunchie is too slick to stay by itself and would need to be folded over several times eliminating that cute chunky oversized look that this is supposed to give.<br /><br />Although I’m a little let down by the practical use potential of the product, I do like this and will definitely continue to use it for special occasions just not daily wear.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615tlA-YfOL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615tlA-YfOL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615tlA-YfOL._SL256_.jpg'}

3.0,"Decently longevity and appearance, but some shades not wearable","This lipstick set comes in 2 sets of 5, Set A and Set B.  I wound up only opening the ""A"" set, as after trying these 5 and finding only 2 to work for me, I decided to give the ""B"" set away.  From the photos, I thought that the colors would be nice and muted, but that's not really the case.  The color I am wearing in the photo is ""Almost Friday,"" which is a pretty neutral, nude-ish pink.  I also kept ""Blush for Me,"" a light, brownish peach.  The red shade, ""Red for Me,"" was very bright and didn't seem to belong to the rest of this collection.  But the other shades seemed MUCH less intense than in the product photos.  Rather than buying a set of 10 like this, I think most people would be better off choosing individual shades that work best for them.<br /><br />Two other things to note.  When I opened one of the lipsticks, the color cylinder popped out and onto my floor, so I wonder about quality.  Also, to open the tubes, you have to unscrew them rather than simply pull the top off.

InstaNatural really packed this moisturizer with the very best of the best ingredients. the list is long and you will be getting so much more with this cream that with others that only have a few things in it.<br /><br />This product is 98% natural its a really rich cream and makes the skin ultra soft. I have use many creams and found this one moisturized better than I expected. The price for this is just the best with all the science and care they have put into this cream it should cost more. I love the way my skin feels after applying it .<br /> My skin is tight and dry but using this cream makes my face feel so refreshed and soft.I use this one on top of my serum and it works really well and dose not pill. (I really hate it when products pill) . it absorbs into the skin quickly and performs superbly. As I said I have used many many moisturizers for my face this one is just so rich and creamy its better at moisturizing that many I have tried that are so much more expensive.<br />This product ships quickly and is packaged really well . I really love everything about it .<br /><br />I was sent a free sample in order to make an informed review but my opinions are my own,[],B00KCTER3U,B00KCTER3U,AFNYEHJYJJA6AGJDB7WZOD6SFKRA,1401812627000,2,False

5.0,LOVE these wonderful scents!!! But…,"There are three main things that are special about this hand sanitizer:<br /><br />(1) they ALL smell WONDERFUL.<br />(2) they pack a LOT of sprays into these tiny bottles so they are especially great for travel. They supposedly hold 500 sprays.<br />(3) if you love Disney, these are cute as can be!<br /><br />But there are two things I don’t like so much:<br />(1) the cost. If you really get 500 sprays out of each bottle, maybe that’s not a bad value on a per use basis— but about $50 for 4 of these is more money than a lot of people have to spend on hand sanitizer.<br />(2) I can’t see any way to refill them. Most purse size hand sanitizers can be refilled—even though you wouldn’t get the same great smelling original product.<br /><br />Overall, these are certainly wonderful products and I LOVE them!

5.0,...If Ivory soap and lemon PEZ had a love child,"Arko is a great economy shaving soap.  The smell was not offensive at all to me and actually has grown on me somewhat since I started using it.  I can best describe the smell as clean and lemony; if Ivory soap and lemon PEZ had a love child Arko shave soap would come out.  This tallow based soap produces an amazingly thick lather but it takes a bit more work to do so than with a glycerine based soap or cream.  While this soap can be lathered on the face straight from the stick that seemed kind of awkward and messy for me because the whole stick got wet so I just cut a chunk off, put it into a shave bowl then lather my brush from there.  The price is great and the stick lasts a long time.  I award Arko all five stars, 4.5 for the soap's overall quality and price and the remaining half star for the retro, swanky lathered-face guy on the wrapping.  In my opinion, Arko is definitely worth a try.  For ease of comparison, TOBS is the gold standard I judge other products to due to its feel, smell and value.  Arko, despite its wrapping and non-regal smell, shaves as good as anything I have ever used.  Enjoy, hope this helps.",[],B002A5OLHQ,B002A5OLHQ,AFNMD3RZMPLSOOKW7KUVC2CTWC3A,1401023890000,2,True

I've used it a couple of times now and have the most luck dropping a couple of drops on each nail of one hand and then dampening a cotton ball with the remover and wiping away the polish. I sometimes have to re-wet or use a second cotton ball to finish out one hand, but not usually. Then I repeat for the next hand. It's really not any more difficult, but does take just a tad more time, which I find well worth it.  I absolutely love that it's all natural and made from all gentle ingredients.

You need only a little dab - using too much could get messy.  It softens at body temperature but doesn't turn into an oily liquid.  It is quite nice and refreshing.  It's an odd greenish color.<br /><br />But the product is a bit confusing to me.  It is for external vaginal use only.

5.0,"My hair LOVES this product. Provides a well-defined, extremely moisturized and bouncy twist out.","This is an extremely moisturizing cream that my 4a/4b hair absolutely drinks up!! My hair is extremely dry after washing and letting it air dry (even though I always add a leave-in and oil). So, I decided to use this to help moisturize and twist my hair. I could just feel my hair going from super dry to extremely soft and moisturized from just one application of each section! I also applied this over castor oil, which I applied to my hair beforehand. (I use the L.O.C. moisturization method).<br /><br />I then twisted my hair and applied this generously (my twist outs always come out better when I'm more generous with my product of choice). After 10 hours or so, I took out my twists and had a very well-defined twist out! There was absolutely no frizz - even after separating each twist (I undo the twist and the split each section in half). I'm really happy with the results.<br /><br />The pics I'm included are of a two-day-old twist out  (I forgot to take a pic on the first day) and my hair still looks great - a little frizzy from sleeping on it, but nothing horrible. I just spritzed on a little leave-in conditioner to refresh my hair and it looked just as good as the first day. This cream is wonderful and allows me to easily go 4-5 days on one twist out - something that many other products just don't do for my hair.<br /><br />This has a really sweet, pleasant smell to it. It's a white cream that's on the thick side, but very easy to work with and absorbs nicely into the hair - doesn't just sit on top. I also love that it doesn't make my hair feel all crunchy or crispy. My twist out was really soft and my curls were bouncy. Thanks to providing great hold, amazing definition, and complete hydration for dry, frizzy hair, you can't get wrong using this product!<br /><br />I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are 100% mine.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/613CMvvft3L.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/613CMvvft3L._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/613CMvvft3L._SL256_.jpg'}

2.0,Has a spicy aroma; leaves my hair nourished and enhanced my curls (see update),"This shampoo and conditioner travel-size duo (2 ounces each bottle) has a spicy aroma that is neither pleasant nor offensive but not my favorite smell.  The shampoo produces a medium lather and cleans well. The conditioner is creamy and conditions well. When my hair dried, it had a sheen to it and was well nourished and my curls were enhanced.<br /><br />The current price of $14 for this set is expensive. If this had an intoxicating fragrance I liked and was more reasonably priced, I would have loved it. However, this is not a set I would buy at this price.<br /><br />Note that I get about four uses to this set for my short to medium hair.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/22/20 - This only lasted me three uses. However, I had such trouble getting both the remaining shampoo and conditioner (particularly the conditioner) out of the bottle. They need to change this to a squeeze tube. I actually had to fill the bottle with water several times to dislodge the remaining ingredients.

I don't own white stamping polish, I use Sinful Colors Snow Me White that has been open for 3 days, it works but it's still not proper stamping polish. The black I use is MdU, the absolute holy grail of stamping polishes. But I have to say that these are beyond good! This black is comparable to MdU black in every way, except the smell.

5.0,Made my skin so soft! Amazing!,I've used body scrubs before in the shower but have never used one that I needed to apply after a shower.  Directions indicated that the product was to be applied to clean damp skin. Leave on for 5-10 mins until product dried and then rinse. The scrub has a very light scent of coconut which was very pleasing so you're not going to smell like you've been tanning all day. The consistency is like wet beach sand. I rubbed the product on my legs concentrating on &#34;problem areas&#34; like knees and feet. Rubbed some on my elbows and then on my hands. Left the scrub on for two songs on the radio. When the product dried you can brush off your body like you would brush off grainy beach sand. I rinsed with warm water and my skin felt AMAZING! It was so soft! You don't have to but I do recommend following it with a moisturizer. Can't wait to use the product again.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was the packaging. The plastic jar was fine...it was the shrink wrap that I didn't notice before getting into the shower and was hard to open. The only thing I had in the bathroom that was sharp enough was an Allen wrench (haha) to poke through the shrink wrap.

I tried to show in my second picture just how far you can stretch these until they may snap or lose shape.

2.0,Very thick lotion with an overpowering scent,"It got this for my son, but he refused to use it because of the extremely strong scent. I tried a bit on my hands and it gave me an instant headache. We both likened it to the smell of Axe deodorant, which I think is really odd for a face lotion. I passed it along to my husband, who said he will use it up as a scented lotion for his body, but definitely not on his face. The consistency was too thick for a face lotion, and a bit greasy.

When I saw the name is &#34;Ladies Man&#34; I had a feeling it would be what I was looking for since every woman I've ever known loves a light sweet citrus with vanilla. If I had to say what it smells most like it would a fresh fruity but sweet cake icing. A lot of people would call it a gourmand if talking about cologne. It's very pleasant to smell all day and never overwhelms you like a lot of beard product scents do. I've ordered a full size in both the balm and oil. Just a note because I missed it when I ordered, the shampoo trial is tea tree (I think).

2.0,"""Sea"" Mist is a Misnomer","*Sigh*<br />This product received rave reviews, so I was very excited to purchase and test it out.<br />My hair is naturally very wavy. If the wave doesn't have product, it isn't tame. So, most mornings I dry/straighten it to avoid looking like a wild banshee at work.<br />However, I recently moved to Florida and because of the humidity, my waves are being a bit more cooperative. That being said, a product like this that would help hold the wave throughout the day and tame the &#34;wildness&#34; is desirable. Unfortunately, this has not worked for me as it is advertised.<br />There isn't enough salt to hold the hair in place. Instead of a subtle stiffness to hold the 'beach wave', my hair appeared a droopy, greasy mess that looks like I'd slept in a frying pan (with leftover bacon grease) rather than the just-off-the-surf look that I was anticipating.<br />Everyone's hair is different, so perhaps this product works better for others. My hair is long and thick. I would think that this may work better for people with shorter hair where gravity isn't fighting with the product all day.<br />Okay, so why did I give this more than one star? IT SMELLS AMAZING!

I like that this product is made in the USA, and that it is cruelty free, although ""cruelty free"" claims need to be taken with a grain of salt.<br /><br />The pump bottle works well, and keeps air out of the product, but there is no over-cap or anything, so this is best left on the counter.  Putting it in a travel bag could cause a mess.<br /><br />Although I like this for a day cream, I can't find that it contains any sun protection, so if you are going to spend any time in the sun, you'll need a separate product.<br /><br />This seems a good product, but in my opinion, it is not outstanding, doesn't really differentiate itself from dozens of other products in all price ranges.",[],B07SRW6NVK,B07SRW6NVK,AE6TDCUOKCSCRL5ZHWKEL7QHOA3A,1568211985513,5,False

5.0,"High, high Medium in performance!","I’ve been needing to color in my grays for a few years. I’ve always had thick, dark eyebrows but thyroid disease and age has challenged that somewhat. My brows are thinning out and have decided to start turning full white now. I don’t even color my hair, but I simply cannot do without my signature brows!! I dye them myself every few months, but I usually need a daily touch-up until then.<br /><br />I found a great brow pencil, available in most drugstores, that works really, really well. But it’s overpriced and doesn’t last long at all. I’m constantly having to replace it. I found it early on, and just stayed with it, because it worked. But apparently there are better options out there!<br /><br />I was very open to trying this when I had the chance. It’s not perfect. I do kinda notice more of a very slight smearing over my eyebrows, throughout the day. But only slightly! I do work outdoors and I sweat a lot, so there’s that. I can’t really expect  much more. It holds its own there, I think.<br /><br />The color I chose is VERY close to perfect for me, but just off by a hair. The narrow shape of the applicator is ideal in some ways, but also somewhat limiting (in a hurry). I love it because I can target certain areas of sparseness, but it may also cause an over-abundance of application in areas that don’t need it, while trying to just quickly cast a tint. Greys are impossible beasts, anyway!!<br /><br />The texture of this is quite firm, so it hasn’t even threatened to break off and get wasted that way. And it is a little dry, but not overly so. It’s at that cusp though, to be sure.<br /><br />I find this pencil to be easy to use, with satisfying enough results. I will probably order this again.

4.0,Good temporary tint,"This tint kit comes with all the essentials you need. I like that it has an angled brush for application, I'm able to be more precise. The mix, color and application are all great. The reason I docked one start is because it fades quickly. Part of eyebrow tinting is that it dyes your skin in the sparse areas to make it look more full, however, the skin dye comes off after a day (two max). You will have perfect eyebrows for one day and after that the hair stays dyed for about 5 days.<br /><br />For the price I'm very happy and will buy this again.

3.0,Great for Travel,"As most have said here – these are great for travel, especially when you can’t find soap around but have water. Though I wouldn’t carry a bar of soap, I have used “travel” size body wash as a hand soap. If it cleans the body, should clean the hands, right?<br /><br />Anyway …<br /><br />The metal container I got was dented, but that is okay as I don’t intend to travel where I won’t have soap. So, I’m using these at my bathroom sink.<br /><br />LET ME STATE THIS AS A WARNING: HANDS MUST BE DRY BEFORE GRABBING A SOAP SHEET.<br /><br />I know all caps is yelling, but trust me – it is for a VERY GOOD reason. As one reviewer said, even a drop of water can damage these.<br /><br />Basically I grab a one with dry hands, hold it in palm, turn water on, let it dissolve. Good lather, I don’t really smell a “scent”, hands wash clean. They don’t dry out, but I do use a moisturizing sanitizer, and hand lotion after.<br /><br />I wouldn’t say these go years – if you’re like me and using them as an alternative to other hand soaps to preserve waste, they might last about a month (8 washes per day, 30 days). If only as travel backup – they might last a few years. Again, it depends on how they’re used.<br /><br />I personally find them a bit on the pricey side at almost $10 before tax. That’s just me.<br /><br />I do have other soaps, and these should last me a while. I would not recommend them as a body wash. As opposed to carrying a bar of soap, try a travel container with body wash. Just my suggestion.",[],B09473GGM4,B09473GGM4,AF4P6A3SEKS2HCISWAKFZVIFM7NQ,1626746723600,1,False
4.0,"Basic, Good Quality, Affordable","So I got this out and started using it on my husband immediately.  It is perfect for cleaning up the hairline.  My husband can't stand hair on his neck so it cleans it up very well.  If you plan to use this to give yourself a haircut, your hair will be very short when done.  It has clips but they aren't for longer hair.  My best friend cuts his own hair but his is longer and he uses a kit that has more clip sizes with it.  If you are concerned you might not know how to use this well, get online and watch videos.  There are so many that will tell you exactly how to do it and how to use clippers.  If you keep your hair very short, this is good to use so you don't have to go back to the barber too quickly and can keep a big haircut at bay.  Look at the width of the head and make sure that suits you.  That was something I hadn't considered until I started using this.  I think it would be easier to maneuver for the beard if it were just a little narrower.  However, with the size it is you can cover more area much more quickly, with fewer passes.  It removes the hair very well with just one pass.  It doesn't come with oil but it is recommended you oil this as needed.  It comes with a cable for charging.  Because it is cordless, I can use it anywhere and that is very convenient.  The clips go one easy and can be a little harder to get off.  The more I'm using them though, the more accustomed to it I am becoming.",[],B078SWLT3L,B07HR5QSN2,AGFVNGZJ4XEFX2ULJNDCWJYRHQVA,1535415555705,0,False

4.0,YOU ONLY GET ONE PACK - THAT'S ONE TYPE,"I gotta start off my review by telling you to be very cautious when purchasing these face mask. Because the photo shows you 4 different types of mask, but based on your selection you will only be getting one box of face mask. Inside this box it's the same type of mask and no other variety.<br /><br />I gotta say I do love using sheet mask, they always provide my skin the extra glow and moisture it needs during the harsh winters. These face mask have plenty of serum on the mask and inside the packaging that you can lather on your skin. I purchased the aqua pack because I needed more moisture overall. Each of the different mask has a different purpose so read the description before you make your selection.<br /><br />Each of the mask are individually wrapped so they're perfect to take on the go or in an overnight bag. All you need to do is open and unwrap the folded mask and align it with your face. Compared to many other sheet mask, these fit my face shape perfectly without having all these air bubbles. Leave it on your face for 15-20 minutes and then rub the additional juices and slap your face slightly so it absorbed completely.

5.0,Good for just about everything!,"I go through these like water!  Same formula, different bottles, for use on skin or surfaces.  I use it on counters, phones, keyboards, jewelry, leather chair, and am about to use it on wood floors (although I will wipe after a minute so area doesn't remain wet).  and many other things.  It does not sting as would alcohol based  products if you have cuts on your hands, and from what I have researched, it will actually help heal them!  A family member used it on her little daughter's eczema, and it cleared it up!  Use it on shopping cart handles and even on restaurant utensils especially during flu season.  No wiping necessary is a great convenience, also, so long as the surface will not be harmed when remaining wet for a length of time.  Constructive Criticism:  The bottles could be improved. Sometimes they are hard to open and close.  The plastic edge is sharp and you need to be careful when struggling with this as it can hurt your hand (especially if wet).  The stream setting on the bottle is useless to me and, in fact, is annoying since one has to remember which way to turn the nozzle for the regular spray or it will be necessary to turn often hard to turn on-off part back to off and then on again, turning it to the spray side.  The little bottles are overpriced, and it the company suggests not refilling from larger bottles, although they do seem to think it is OK if you are careful not to contaminate anything.  Would be nice if they did not discourage this as one is paying so much to be sure the product is effective.  It would also be great to have expiration dates printed on the label.  There are other products such as Lysol  that have jumped on the bandwagon that use the magic of hypochlorous, but I prefer Clean Smart because other companies do not state that their product can be safely used so diversely (perhaps due to the percent of active ingredient being higher in other products?).  Very important:  This product can be used around cats!  The company says, even if they lick it when wet, it will not harm them!  A helpful tip:  If you are spraying a surface where the product beads and you need to have the product contact the entire surface, what I do is use a paper towel to make sure the entire area is wet.  If necessary, spray twice.  If Simple Science is reading this, I hope they will consider the improvements I mentioned.",[],B00GX1RFEY,B00GX1RFEY,AHDN4QEEM3Z7N5HTOY2YAX7FZ5ZA,1566060759569,17,True

4.0,"I got leaking inside the cap, but it didn't come out.","This is a nice spray bottle kit, it comes with 2 funnels and a sheet of labels, I found the labels too small for use, each one is approximately 1 inch x 1/2 inch in diameter, and not sure if it can be used in an inkjet printer or not. All 10 spray bottles included all the necessary parts, and the stem that draws up liquid was long in each one, none were short and I really appreciated that. You should be able to spray down to the last drop.  I tested mine with rubbing alcohol, for sanitizing my phones. The funnel came in handy for filling the bottle. It made the job so easy! The sprayer does spray a very fine mist. I used it several times to clean some things then left it overnight with the cap on. Next day I tested it again. First off, the cap contained some of the rubbing alcohol inside it, which means the container will leak into the cap standing up. Not necessarily a huge deal breaker, but a negative for me. Holding it in my hand I got the rubbing alcohol on my finger too, so this may waste product just from this. Several drops every 24 hours may not seem like a lot, but if you make your own essential oil room spray then this could be an expensive waste. Lastly, I had an issue with the spray top, the angle is so slight I wasn't sure if I would spray myself in the face of I wasn't wearing eyeglasses. You have to be careful, ensuring you're spraying away from yourself. I did not get any leakage of the alcohol out of the cap, it seemed pretty tight.  It did pool in the cap, didn't run down the bottle.  I did get a rubbing alcohol ring when I set down the cap on my coffee table tho.  Beware of that possibility whatever you use in these bottles.<br />All in all, a nice kit and I give it 4 stars.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615VxUvYI-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615VxUvYI-L._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615VxUvYI-L._SL256_.jpg'}

5.0,Very best shaving soap there is,"Very best shaving soap there is, and I've used dozens and have years of experience as well as belong to the shave forums. It has tallow so it is super slick and cushiony allowing for a maximum of comfort and protection of the blade. Skin moisturization is superb and the only soap that beats it in that area is Provence Sante IMO. Also since this soap is made in the EU it must comply with EU regulations on safety and labeling requirements. American soaps aren't regulated and they can put whatever caustic or toxic substances they want in them and even make up the ingredients. A member of Badger and Blade proved How to Grow a Mustache (now renamed Phoenix Accoutrements) shaving soap made in USA, couldn't possibly have the ingredients that it did. After that the soap maker changed the label to reflect the true ingredients. Supposedly, but there is no way to be sure. With any EU made soap you can be assured it is correctly labeled.<br /><br />Some people have trouble lathering this soap but it is merely operator error. It is as easy to lather as any other soap and easier than some. I use a synthetic brush mostly and face lather exclusively. It does require more loading time with a super soft silvertip badger though.<br /><br />Note on price- DO NOT buy this soap from American vendors if you don't want to get ripped off. You can find it at half the price from UK or Irish vendors and shipping is the same price.",[],B001LY7FRK,B001LY7FRK,AERNLAEURGQE3QBJYLYI6QAFNK4A,1416506162000,3,False

I am used to argan oil having a pleasant scent but this one was a complete let down and was borderline not pleasant.<br /><br />When you use the oil and apply it to your skin it is pretty lightweight so that statement is correct.

5.0,HOT PINK!!!!!,I actually purchased the Aneomne Wind Flower Hair Dryer by XTAVA but was sent the Peony by mistake. However when I opened the package I just fell in love with the bright pink dryer!  Pink is after all my favorite color!  The Peony is compact and will fit in a suitcase with ease for traveling. I love the multiple speeds and the different heat settings. I have fairly short hair and this dried my hair in a matter of minutes on medium speed. It would have taken less time if I didn't have to use brushes to style with.  It does come with two concentrator nozzles one for long hair and one for short.  I love these because I use a round brush and this allows me to direct heat to the area I'm working on and the rest of my hair isn't blowing around all over the place. It is a bit loud but that doesn't bother me and I don't find any any heavier than other dryers I've had that are made by XTAVA. All in all I love the dryer and expect to have years of use from it as long as my nieces don't steal it just because of the girly color. I was offered the Aneomme Wind Flower Dryer at a substantial discount for testing and providing feedback. Please know that Amazon offered me a mailing label to return the dryer so I wouldn't be out any money for returning.

Better than an electric razor"".<br /><br />That's the first thing my husband had to say after he tested SUPRENT's  Matrix Cutter Head travel kit razor for the first time.  And what a kit this is. A razor handle, 2-blade refills (each with the first of its kind 6 ultra-thin blades total!), a dock to hold the razor and a bottle of shaving foam are included.<br /><br />The handle is sleek and heavy but easy and comfortable to hold.  The head doesn't pivot  but it doesn't need to thanks to the 38.5 degree shaving angle. It glides perfectly along the jaw line and chin areas without missing a spot.<br /><br />The base is heavy-ish and holds the razor well. Doesn't tip or wobble.<br /><br />He's not a fan of the shaving foam. Says he must 'really rub it in' in order for it to foam.  He used it once and switched back to his regular brand.<br /><br />Suprent has really come out with an awesome razor kit. The presentation is gorgeous and the product works exceptionally well.

But I still want to get rid of them completely, if possible, for sure.<br /><br />I’ve used topical lotion to get rid of cellulite in the past and some worked and others no so much.  So, I wasn't sure what kind of results this cream will deliver.  Most of the review shows awesome results and I wanted to try this cream.<br /><br />It's been a month since I start to use this.  I am pretty sure every skin/body types react to cream differently and some may show results sooner and others may take longer.  Unfortunately, I have skin type that takes while to get used to the product.  As expected, this cellulite cream does work, but not as fast as some reviewers indicated.<br /><br />On 3rd week of using this cream, my cellulite does look less noticeable.  I did what I call &#34;pinch test&#34; (pinch my skin and see if skin dimples, how the dimple looks - pronounced, slight or none, etc) and skin looks much smoother.  I believe it would get rid of them if I continue using this cream.<br /><br />This is very thick cream. Even if it isn't for the cellulite, it smells good and it make my skin soft.<br />Also, I didn’t shower or bath at least hour after I applied cream.

4.0,"Great heat protection, somewhat difficult to clean","I ordered this silicone pad to place on my vanity so that I could rest my curling/straightening irons on it while getting ready without having to worry about scorching the wood vanity top. Overall, it works well and it just small enough to squeeze between the two drawers that come up on either side of my vanity. I have a love/hate feeling for the little raised &#34;dots&#34; that cover each side of the mat. I like them because they raise the hot tool when resting on the mat to give extra heat protection to my vanity top underneath it. However, I also put my makeup on at my vanity and because of the silicone surface, every little drop of makeup powder is attracted to and clings to the silicone mat surface. The silicone isn't that difficult to clean (I use either pledge spray or a lysol wipe), but the little raised dots make it difficult to get into all the little grooves in order to get the mat perfectly clean. I could move the mat while I put my makeup on, but I don't have many places to put it on where I get ready, so this would be a huge inconvenience. Plus, regardless of where i put the mat, it will still collect dust overtime and have the same cleaning issue.<br />As a solution to cleaning the mat, I started running it under warm water and using a dish brush with bristles to scrub the mat and get in those difficult grooves, which has been successful as far as perfectly cleaning the mat - it's just a little more tedious than I'd like it to be.",[],B00A0RUGPM,B00A0RUGPM,AFUT2GCF5TIZDVYRT2IACBMJYSLQ,1455521957000,1,True

3.0,Cute MOM gift but not as fragrant or impressive as I expected,"[[VIDEOID:f77804a8088c40dfbef6fdcfacf8b15a]] There are three individually wrapped bath bombs in this set along with one bar of hand soap and a package of dried rose petals. In total there are five items. The bath bombs spell MOM with the heart substituting for the letter O.<br /><br />The outside packaging looks giftable but the inside is just an ordinary uninspiring throw-away box. The fragrance of the bombs and soap is hardly noticeable. It has a whisper of rose aroma and I detect no lavender at all. I did try the letter M bomb in a hand bath and it dissolved in 5 minutes in lukewarm water and a nice foam of suds lasted about 10 minutes. The results initially felt moisturizing because my hands felt a little oily after the hand bath; however, eventually I needed to moisturize my hands with lotion.<br /><br />With regard to the dried petals, one has to like something like that in their bath because it requires straining the water so that they don't go down the drain. For me, I would never use petals in a bath, so keep the recipient in mind when ordering this.<br /><br />The bar of soap is the only item that would be used by most people.<br /><br />One thing I love is that the color of the dissolved bomb did not adhere to my skin, my hand bath, or my towel. That is not always the case with bath bombs today.<br /><br />The current price of $9.74 ($12.99 minus 25%) comes to $1.95 per item which is reasonable.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/718JxZzRsNL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/718JxZzRsNL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/718JxZzRsNL._SL256_.jpg'}

5.0,Nice electric shaver by Wahl,"I had a set of Wahl clippers that lasted for over a decade. I finally got a new pair of clippers and through the old clippers away. I miss my old Wahl clippers they were a super workhorse set of clippers. I had no idea that Wahl even made shavers.<br /><br />I have had quite a few high-end electric shavers, and they all have the same problem, they just don't shave as close as a razor. The positive thing about electric shavers is that they are easy to use for quick touch ups and convenient shaves when you don't want to mess with water and creams and lotions.<br /><br />This Wahl shaver, in particular, is pretty nice. It shaves about as close as other electric shavers, which isn't as close as a manual razor, but with repeated use and going back and forth, it is better than no shave. Some type of pre-shave lotion, like Williams Lectric shave, helps a little.<br /><br />Still, this is a pretty decent shaver. It charges fast and holds the charge for a long time. The top pops off easy to clean the blades. You can use the provided brush or just rinse it off with water. You can also use it in the shower or wet/dry shave. The directions say not to submerge it under 3 feet of water.<br /><br />It also has a shaver that pops up for sideburns or whatever you would want a clean smooth line on. Bottom line this is a pretty good shaver.",[],B01MTQW0BK,B01MTQW0BK,AEOOXF62OUVMNQOUID3XFDHMKXRQ,1484692687000,0,False

5.0,Why this is a good value...,"This is pure genius.<br />After unscrewing the top of the cap, you'll see the film that protects the batteries. After you remove it, put the top back on and separate the light unit from the jar.<br />The red LED light will be activated by pressing against your skin. Does that light actually do anything, or is it a gimmick?<br />There are a number of high-priced red light units on the market. They were first used in dermatologist offices and med spas. When they first came out, I had a red Tanda unit. This is exactly the same concept, and yes, you will have a slight difference.<br />The amount of cream gone in the jar has been for about 10 applications. I do it at night so I can relax while holding the unit at various places on my face. The red light goes on when you press slightly on the metal ring, as you can see in the photographs. As you press it to the area of your face that you want treated, slide it from the middle of your face outward, for 3 minutes. Then go to the next area. This way you get a little bit of a lymphatic massage. If you suffer with sinus headaches, this action is very good at offering some relief.<br /> The cream is very lightly fragranced with a fresh scent. It's a gel or mousse type of cream.<br />After purchasing this, you can get the cream refill.<br /><br />So much cheaper than buying an LED light device like a Tanda.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81+KP+04LjL._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81+KP+04LjL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81+KP+04LjL._SL256_.jpg'}

The only thing I definitely don’t use it for is my home-made cleaning products where citrus oils are the only essential oils.<br /><br />This particular oil is a very delicate scent – some lavender oils can pack quite a punch in terms of the scent. This is certainly floral and has a ‘high note’ to it. You can easily pick it out of a blend. It’s my first oil from New York Biology and I’m very pleased.<br /><br />I love blending lavender in particular with chamomile, as it has an almost instantaneous calming effect. Also love to blend it with bergamot, ylang ylang, mandarin, and a drop of lime.<br /><br />The bottle is very large, a dark brown color to protect the oil from UV rays which can damage the oils and decrease the shelf life. My favorite way to dispense oils is with the eye dropper (the euro droppers found in smaller bottles tend to gush several drops at once, so that’s definitely not my preference) – you can really control how many drops you dispense with these eye droppers.<br /><br />Arrived well protected in bubble wrap and there was no leaks.<br /><br />* I received the oil for evaluation and review",[],B01IG41ZG4,B01IG41ZG4,AGEAJ3SCOEQVBB6CZ2L3VOSZNR6Q,1474824730000,0,False

Make NO mistake, these are SHARP.  Use them delicately and only on smooth skin.  If you have a blemish, a mole or anything just slightly raised on your skin, it will be cut off.  You will bleed.

The sponge tip is great for softening the sharp line on the thicker area of my brow and i dab it with a bit of eye shadow to set it.  The color stays put and looks natural without leaning towards red. What more can you ask of a good brow pencil for brunettes? I overplucked my brows in my youth when pencil-thin brows were was the style (okay, I'm dating myself here) but this seems to apply quickly and easily and works well with super-thin brows without making me look like Groucho Marx.

5.0,Amazing.,"This is the best mask I have tried so far. The texture is strange, it doesn't have the mud texture, but rather a chocolate gelatin pudding texture.<br />You just use a thin layer, so you don't need a lot, and the bottle is huge so it will definitely last a while! Then you leave it on for 15 minutes. After having it on for about 10 minutes it started to burn, I could literally feel all of the impurities being sucked out of my pores. It was only a slight burning sensation so I wasn't worried. I have extremely sensitive skin, so I was nervous to see how my skin reacted once I took it off.<br />I love that it doesn't make a mess in the sink when you take it off like other masks do, it just turned the water a slight grey color.<br />After taking off the mask, certain areas of my face were red but that subsided within about 20 minutes, but it literally looked like it sucked all of my impurities out of my pores. I had 75% less blackheads after I used this mask. I was AMAZED. I never thought I would see results like this after just one application. My face felt incredibly smooth, clean, and hydrated. I love this mask, and I will definitely make it one of the staples to my beauty regimen. I definitely recommend to anyone that wants to help their skin.<br />I was very excited to receive this product in one of their promotional offers in exchange for a honest review.",[],B0140EEAX4,B0140EEAX4,AHB7QPVKBRHBND5YR4UX7JSFVRTQ,1440697034000,3,False

5.0,"Easily absorbed, may not be the fountain of youth, but feels good on the skin","eb5 line has been around for some time now and I have noticed their advertisements in print media over the years, but have not tried any of the line until I received this bottle of Collagen Booster Serum.  I am very surprised that I like this serum as much as I do, and I am more surprised at the competitive pricing for the entire line.  With no added fragrance, my sensitive skin responded well to the light and creamy product that was readily absorbed.  My skin was prepared for moisturizing and there was no irritation or annoyance due to a fragrance of the natural components which can occur.  The pump action is terrific and the cap keeps it protected from the elements, yet it is quick to remove for application.  There is no excessive packaging, so little waste.  Many years ago, Robert Heldfond Jr. and I were casual friends in San Francisco, occasionally having coffee together in North Beach, and I have thought of him each time I would see his father's picture in the advertisements I mentioned earlier.

The other good part is that they’re kinder to hair compared to normal elastics/ hair ties because don’t pull hair out whilst removing.<br />The only downside to these is that they appear quite pricey for $25.99 for a pack of 6.

5.0,Immediate Results...,"The wintertime is so drying & my dad hands tend to get such bad dry skin that it cracks, exposing painful lesions all over.<br />We both started using it the first day it arrived.  Much to both of our surprises, it immediately began showing noticeable results on the first application.  When I say immediate, I mean right after we applied it our skin was much softer.  It wasn't that noticeable on the areas that were already healthy and soft.  The areas with cracked or excessively dry skin were immediately transformed into soft and moisturized skin.  It feels kind of tingly and minty going on also.<br />As far as the smell goes, its not noticeable unless you are trying to smell it which I probably wouldn't because what I can smell of it, I didn't really hate it but I definitely wasn't into it either.  It's a strange rusted orange color but does not leave stains on anything because it soaks into fabric/clothes just as regular lotion does.  The texture is a nice, thick one but considering, it soaks into the skin fairly fast.  Actually quicker then most other thick creams used for this purpose.",[],B075MC221Y,B08YK8B89C,AE7P3G7DWP3VVFKOK2H2PPTK2TOA,1577657288780,1,True
2.0,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this body scrub. It’s priced high so I expected it to be high quality. I was disappointed as soon as I opened it, the product was separated. All of the thick gritty stuff was on one side and all of the liquid oily stuff was on the other side. I had to physically stir it up before I could even use it.<br /><br />The smell was overpowering. It wasn’t necessarily bad, just was too strong. I also thought the scrub was way too rough. I used it on my knees and it was border line painful. There is no way I could use this on sensitive skin areas like my stomach or chest. After rinsing off the grit in the bottom of the tub literally hurt my feet stepping on it.<br /><br />I also do not like how there is no ingredients list on the jar.

It's a little tricky to quickly identify the inside and the outside of the hair band, because it all looks so similar, but there's a seam down the middle of the inside part.

4.0,"Nice cream, gimmicky packaging","When I opened this package, I had no idea what I was looking at. Inside the Amazon packaging bag was another bag, a plastic bag with a bubble wrap lining and a ziplock type zipper. Inside that, was what looked like a syringe. Honestly, I was at first convinced I had the wrong order as I had no recollection of ordering anything matching what I was seeing. Upon further investigation, I discovered it was the Play Pretend brand of under eye cream. Yes, the Amazon product page does state the the cream comes in a syringe-like tube, and yes, it does state that it comes with a skincare travel bag, this wasn’t what I had envisioned.<br />On to the product…<br />Once I figured out how to open and operate the syringe (hint: remove the large, clear cap, remove the white tip, turn the plunger to unlock) to dispense the under eye cream, I applied some to my face. The scent is strong, like cucumber with an underlying perfume smell. Not unpleasant, but kind of strong for me, someone who is overly sensitive to scents. My problem, I know, and most people will probably really enjoy the scent. The cream is white, smooth, goes on evenly and is absorbed quickly. There is a bit of a cooling sensation which I found pleasant.<br /><br />The travel bag seems unnecessary to me. It’s really not much more than a heavy ziplock bag lined with bubble wrap with a large logo reading “Skin Set Go.”  If someone needs a bag, great, but I have several and I don’t think I’ll be using this one.<br /><br />According to the company’s website, Skin Care Go products are made in the USA in small batches. Good. A lot of natural ingredients go into the product, which I like, but the complete list of ingredients from the company’s website is as follows:<br /><br />Water (Aqua), Carthamus Tinctorius Seed Oil, Polyacrylate-13, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Polyisobutene, Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Butylene Glycol, Polysorbate 20, Acetyl Octapeptide-3, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, Yellow 5 (CI 19140), Blue 1 (CI 42090).<br /><br />The final verdict:<br />The product is nice, and while I’d personally prefer something less heavily scented, I like the way the cream works and what it does for my skin. It’s very hydrating and brightening, with nothing that irritated my skin. I understand the idea behind the syringe dispenser: it’s unique, it’s fun, it’s memorable. However, there’s a ton of plastic used that isn’t necessary, and with the design, I don’t know how I’ll know when the tube is nearing empty.<br />Overall, this is a good product, does what it says it does, and if you’re looking for something a little unusual, give it a try.",[],B08Y7HV8CQ,B08Y7HV8CQ,AGQFUBXP54N5SB54U5LRPL62B2NQ,1635091963994,1,False

I don’t think there is any reason they would come off unintentionally. The eyelashes are stored in a case, unlike some others. I think it’s certainly easier than using traditional lashes but the liner still takes a little skill.

While I don’t readily detect a heady scent of lavender oil, I will say that an earthy tea tree scent is freshly omnipresent. I love that this is a vegan, cruelty-free product that’s been consciously sourced, packaged, and produced, and the included pump dispenser seems to be quite sturdy and reliable. I appreciate that the bottle arrived with a secure safety seal in place, and I definitely didn’t have any product leak out during shipment. There’s also an expiration date handily provided on the bottle’s base.<br /><br />This slippery, soapy gel solution creates a visible sudsing effect, and it feels quite hydrating overall!

3.0,"Moisturizes, Comforts, Some Color Correction-Emphasizes My Pores, Need An Ingredient List","JUNGSAEMMOOL Minifying Cica Mist Balm is a moisturizing balm for sensitive skin that soothes irritation and helps redness. It’s described as having green calamine to tone down redness and cica pine water to calm skin. But I’m unable to find a full ingredient list. The box has directions in English but lacks an ingredient list in English, so I don’t know what’s even in this product. I have dry, sensitive skin and avoid many skincare ingredients, so I won’t make this balm or any product part of my daily routine without an ingredient list.<br /><br />I have used this balm a few times after my moisturizer and before foundation (if wearing makeup). The balm smells light and pleasant, and it adds some comforting moisture. While it tends to sink into my skin, I do get some color correction of redness on my nose and cheeks. But it’s less than I get with my corrective color makeup. If the balm has healthy ingredients that benefit my skin while also correcting some degree of redness, I’d likely prefer it to just hiding redness with makeup. But I can’t judge if the trade off is there without knowing ingredients.<br /><br />This balm also makes my skin smoother. It feels like it might have silicone and/or glycerin and feels a lot like a primer under my makeup. I like the moist and spreadable texture, except it’s so soft I can’t just swipe across the top with the puff for an even amount of product as it smooshes in the balm and gouges out pieces (which I then spread and dab with the puff).

I would say its just my nose but I've also had my husband, best friend, and her sister smell it and they all say it leans on the masculine side.

5.0,Fantastic Value!,"The Butterfly Nail Art Decals Water Transfer Stickers bundle is a great deal. You get 22 full sheets of stickers. Each sheet has over 50 stickers as far as I've counted them. They are either multi-colored and halographic or metallic outlined patterns. Every sheet is a little different, so there are no repeats. They apply easily, but I highly recommend doing a base coat first and a coat on top as well. There are also 2 generously filled jars of holographic butterflies that measure 4mm by 4mm at the widest points. This is a really pretty collection of butterflies and I couldn't recommend them more for both the value and variety!",[],B08G15JBYN,B08G15JBYN,AE3X7PNUWXQU6FZQLQGIA6ZT45QA,1603750716714,0,False

4.0,Great For Relieving the Worst of Itches,"I got these after running into a nest of seed ticks and finding myself in a constant state of itch for about a month.  Using these in the shower on my skin was one of the few moments of relief I had.  These contain a piece of loofa stitched very well onto a cloth pad with a piece of elastic over the back to keep on your hand. I didn't realize until recently that loofas are made from the dried insides of gourds. So, no, they're not a product of the sea like a sponge. It's amazing to me that they're able to be stitched so well into cloth.  I really like these. I just read that it's possible to machine wash loofa but that you shouldn't put them through the dryer. Eventually, my loofa got moldy from hanging out in the shower so often. I threw it away, but next time I'll know that I can put it through the washing machine before it gets to that state. Luckily, this is a 3-pack.",[],B08B5FJMHM,B08B5FJMHM,AFDGZOROW6QIY6VNQHTSSF3G6RGA,1602281588869,0,False
5.0,Great water pressure,This hose head is really made well.  It’s solid metal and has a nice heavy duty feel to it.  I was a little confused at first because it comes with that smaller screw in attachment already screwed into the base.  I almost though I got something that wasn’t for a garden hose but you just need to unscrew it an take that piece out if your using with a standard garden house.<br /><br />The water stream comes out very strong and it is adjustable by turning the head.  It does have the little metal clip so you can lock it and not have to keep holding the handle down.  What I really like though is the water pressure aspect.  I’ve been using those expandable garden hoses and they tend to not give you much pressure.  This head really gives you the extra pressure and makes it so I can reach the further spots of the yard.  I’m very impressed with this.  All around it’s a well made product.,"[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610SpzhFAQL.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610SpzhFAQL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610SpzhFAQL._SL256_.jpg'}

4.0,"Weightless, Skin Feels Silky, Makeup Lasts Longer, Blurs Lines-Odd Smell, Skin Gets Weird Sensation","This Grown Alchemist Anti-Pollution Primer has a gel texture that feels weightless on my skin. This doesn’t have a lot of ingredients and lacks chemical fragrance, but I find the scent is moderately strong. I assume it’s mostly from natural lavender, rose and grapefruit oils. I really don’t love the scent as it smells odd to me, but it mellows out and doesn’t really bother me. The lavender and grapefruit oils are potential irritants, but my sensitive skin hasn’t had any visible reaction or real discomfort using this primer.<br /><br />I have dry skin and when I apply the primer my skin feels a weird initial sensation that reminds me of alcohol, but so far it hasn’t caused any visible dryness. I do always apply a hydrating essence, serum and cream before the primer and I see the primer has glycerin, so that may be why I don’t see dryness or maybe something in this just feels mildly irritating to my skin. This does have benzyl alcohol pretty low on the list, so maybe I’m feeling that but the good part is that I haven’t had any real issue. I can’t say if daily use might dry my skin.<br /><br />This primer is super lightweight, so sheer it’s invisible and I don’t feel any sticky residue. It makes my skin feel silky, and my cream and liquid foundations spread smoothly and evenly over it. I do notice a blurring effect, especially around my mouth area where I need all the help I can get. My makeup holds up well all day even though the weather has been so really hot lately. Other than that weird sensation I get that does eventually pass, my skin generally feels comfortable. Like it. 4 stars.

5.0,"so soft and bouncy, WOW","These wonder blenders are so soft and bouncy! I cannot get over how soft these are. When you squish them, they bounce right back. These expanded to a good size once I ran them under water. After squeezing out the water, it stayed in the expanded shape. I used this to blend my new serum foundation, it looked flawless! I've gotten quite a few of these blenders online and these are hands down the softest and bounciest blenders I've came across. I don't have a latex allergy but it seems like these are great for anyone with an allergy. On the packaging it also says part of the proceeds will go towards protecting animals against abuse. I didn't do any additional research on that so take it with a grain of salt, but if they do, that's a wonderful cause!<br /><br />I did more research and a lot of people seem to love these and switched to these from the pricey $20 a piece brand. This is so much more affordable and reasonably priced, not to mention it works great. I highly recommend giving these a try as many other people have raved about these as well. If you don't like it after trying, you've still only spent half the amount of what the famous brand costs - my point is, you really don't have anything to lose!

I myself have used several different kits, and this one ranks in my top 5. The results were pretty good and there was noticeable lifting of my lashes.

2.0,"Proven ingredients, but a poor value","I’m not all that impressed with these products. Neither container lists the ingredients on the label, instead providing the ingredient list on a card that’s in the box. It shows that the cleaner is a 2% salicylic acid wash, which is a pretty tried and true formulation for treating acne. It is a low-lather, but still effective cleaner, but I didn’t experience any difference with this compared with other 2% salicylic cleaners that cost far less. It’s a fine cleaner, but way overpriced for such a tiny (0.51 oz) container.<br /><br />The repairing night cream is a combination of retinol (0.05%), niacinamide (3%), and hyaluronic acid (2%). All are proven performers, but again, it’s quite overpriced considering how low of a percentage of retinol is in the formulation. It does a decent job of moisturizing and did not cause any skin irritation. I am a fan of retinol, but the concentration in this cream (0.05%) is well below what I usually use (either 0.1% or 0.5%).<br /><br />While this product combo is on the right track, the value is just not there considering the amount in the container (one-half an ounce for each). While I would certainly recommend a salicylic acid wash and a retinol-based cream, there are many other options that provide these options at a far lower cost.

I have loved all of the Sublime Beauty products that I have used. All of their products are made with high quality ingredients. That is very important to me because I have sensitive skin that will break out easily. I really have to be careful with any products that I use on my face. I have used products with glycolic acid before with great results. I have also used salicylic acid, but it was always in my acne products. I have never used a serum containing both. This serum is truly amazing and I just can't get over how well it works on my face. My acne totally dried up and my pores looked so small and clear, especially all of the pores around my nose. I have very oily skin, so I started using it everyday. I noticed though, that my skin really started to get dry when using it everyday, so I started using it every other day. I still get the same great results, but now I don't have any dryness on my face. This serum is pretty thin and goes on easily. I didn't need to use much to cover my entire face. It absorbed very quickly and I was left with no residue on my face.

4.0,"Nice for travel, but limited use otherwise","These hand wipes are good for traveling or any situation where you might come in contact with something gross and soap and water is unavailable.  I like to pair these wipes with hand sanitizer to help combat dryness from the sanitizer.  I still prefer to use hand lotion over these wipes though.  These wipes make my hands feel softer, but don't help dryness not much.  They are refreshing, but I still want to put hand lotion on after using one of these wipes.<br /><br />The price point of these wipes is high, which is why I don't recommend them for everyday use.  I put one in my purse to use for ""just in case"" situations.<br /><br />I have the unscented wipes, which have a very low odor still.

I use this soap on both my face and body<br />*It's a soft soap, kinda hard to handle. I also followed the suggestion to cut the bar in multiple pieces for easier use.<br />*Storage is simple. Cool dark place.  If you decide to cut the bar in smaller pieces, I would store in a plastic container away from an area that stays warmth/heat. My pieced tended to soften, and melt back together.<br />* I love that it is natural and healthy for your skin. I have sensitive skin and lots of things irritate it.  This did not.<br />* The only think I wasn't fond of was the smell, kinda hard to describe. However that didn't discourage me from continuing to use it.  On the bright side, the smell did rinse off when I rinsed the soap off.<br />* I recommend to anyone on the fence about trying this. It is definitely worth a try.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713xrB+Wk3L._SL1600_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713xrB+Wk3L._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713xrB+Wk3L._SL256_.jpg'}

4.0,Works to dry drippy hair faster after a shower,"The package contained 3 microfiber Towel Wrap Turbans: one pink, one lavender, and one striped (orange, pink, blue, white). They are 26"" in length. After a shower, I've wanted to wrap my long hair up in a towel for a while because otherwise it drips down my back as it dries. But I've never mastered getting a towel to stay in place. This product does help: place the large ""hood"" section in place on your head, tuck your hair into the tail then twist the tail one or two times, and secure the elastic loop over the button. It stays in place okay as long as you don't try to pull a shirt on over it (or similar activity). I put it on for about 20 minutes after my shower, and the Wrap is pretty wet when I take it off. My hair's still damp, but it dries much faster after that and doesn't drip down my back. So it works.","[{'attachment_type': 'IMAGE', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61RWflqLifL.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61RWflqLifL._SL800_.jpg', 'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61RWflqLifL._SL256_.jpg'}

5.0,Plaque finder,This tool is very effective at cleaning between teeth and at the gum line.  Even after flossing I experience this tool to find left over plaque.  I am 69 yrs old and clean teeth and heathy gums are critical to staying healthy overall. I use it about once a week and I get very good checkups with no need to deep clean for exorbitant amounts of money at the dentist office.

5.0,I love this face oil!,"I love face oils and never worry about them being too oily because I only use them at night before bed - that way they have time to seep into the skin and work while I sleep. I just love the smell of this one - especially when the smells are from oils / essential oils, and nothing synthetic. This bottle is just chock full of good stuff, good ingredients, and herbs and things. As we get into the winter season this will be perfect to keep my skin moisturized so at the moment I am using it sparingly. After trying this face oil I am excited to explore other products from Laloirelle because their formulation and ingredients used are exactly the type of stuff I love and trust to use on my skin.",[],B08DXZ5VXB,B08DXZ5VXB,AEH7RAIDBU7QALXTMWAA73PTL4JA,1601764335991,0,False
